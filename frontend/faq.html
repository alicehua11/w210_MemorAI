			<h2>Product Purpose</h2>
			<div class="interview_ans">
				<p>Team MemorAI is obsessed over preserving the life stories of the loved ones for their family to interact with even after they are long gone. Specifically, the life stories should be stored and told the way the loved one wants them to be told. Version 1 of our MemorAI product is an interactive platform that allows people to do just that.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Who Is This Product For?</h2>
			<div class="interview_ans">
				<p>Any family who wants to preserve the life stories of their loved ones and refer back to them in future. We have two primary use cases:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As an adult who has lost my loved ones (e.g. parent) at a young age, I desire to learn the stories of my lost loved ones so that I can get to know them.</li>
					<li>As an early parent with young children, I desire to preserve my stories so that if I pass away unexpectedly, my children can have a chance to know me after they grow up.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2>Why Now? </h2>
			<div class="interview_ans">
				<p>Team MemorAI believes that it is a perfect time to experiment with and leverage advances in the AI field to serve a simple desire of countless families to preserve life stories of their loved ones.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<div class="interview_ans">
				<p>It started when Alice Hua came up with this idea for the Capstone project of the Master of Information and Data Science program at the University of California, Berkeley as her inspiration for helping people find and cherish life moments using technology. She was joined by fellow teammates, Ajit Barhate and Tim Chen, who believed in the mission and possibilities MemorAI could create for all families. Team MemorAI was excited about the learning opportunities while using the cutting edge Natural Language Processing techniques that will fulfill their desire to leverage latest advances in the field to create the MVP of the MemorAI interactive platform. </p>
			</div>
			<h2>Our Vision</h2>
			<div class="interview_ans">
				<p>For the version 1 of our product, we are building an interactive platform for family members to interact with the life stories of their loved ones even if they are long gone. We obsess over preserving these life stories the way they want to be told by the person who they are about. </p>
				<p>We all take countless photographs and videos that are either lost or are not discovered later in the context when needed. We want to build the AI technology that will help solve this problem. In the long term, our vision is to expand this platform to include a media library with photographs and videos that will be shown in the context of the query from the family members. Just imagining such a future gets us excited to go and build it!</p>
				<p>We believe that this will provide the ultimate peace of mind to the person whom this is about and all their beloved family members.</p>
