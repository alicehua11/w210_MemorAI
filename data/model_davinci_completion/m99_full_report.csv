14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's just the challenge of being able to do something that nobody else has done before. I mean, you know, there are certain things where like if somebody does it and then other people repeat it a bunch of times and then eventually somebody repeats it better than anybody else has ever done before. And so like when I'm looking at something that no one's ever climbed or no one's even attempted because they're too afraid to attempt but they've looked at from afar and thought ""Oh my God.""",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," I don't know. I mean, it's like a bunch of different adventures that I've had over the years.",,0.5136649,0.44005167
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I climb without any gear. I use the cracks in the rock to support my hands and feet. The most difficult part is finding a route that suits me, something I can use as holds.""",,0.57600534,0.60839343
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't know. I mean, it's just something that you have to do.",,0.5467132,0.26064572
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later.",,,0.9012281,-0.02494663
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I think it's just a beautiful place. I mean, you know, the granite is so clean and pure and perfect. And then there's this incredible range of mountains that goes up to 14 or 15 thousand feet above sea level. It has all these different faces that are really unique from each other in terms of their geology and how they were formed over time.",,0.7304929,0.35208252
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, you know, when I started soloing back in 2009 or so, it was pretty scary and now after doing quite a bit over the past five years or so. It's not nearly as scary anymore because you kind of get used to being up there by yourself without any rope attached to anything solid below you.",,0.42990872,0.6752087
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I suppose I've just always been drawn to the edge. Maybe it's a genetic thing, maybe it's because my dad was an extreme skier and climber himself. But I think that most of us have some sort of death wish, if you will. Most people don't BASE jump off El Cap or climb solo up big walls like Half Dome or Moonlight Buttress in Washington State--even though they're all-time classic routes with thousands of climbers each year doing them that way.",,0.6296114,0.33482438
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know, I mean it's hard to say. I think that the two things are so different that they're really apples and oranges. You know, climbing is a very social activity you're always with a partner or at least with other people around and you have gear and there's anchors all over the place. And free soloing is just about going out into nature by yourself without any of those things without any gear without anybody else around just taking on this challenge in its purest form, which is why it's such an exciting thing for me personally because it takes me back to my roots as a climber when I was first learning how to climb when everything was about adventure exploration self-discovery challenge basically like what we were doing but not having anything except your own skill \ \ \ \ \ \ . But yeah do all my climbs help prepare for free solos? Maybe maybe not necessarily directly but they definitely help keep me fit physically healthy mentally focused excited about climbing generally stoked on life basically so if anything does prepare for free soloing then probably climbing does right? ### So here we are at El Potrero Chico Mexico one of the best rock areas in North America arguably even better than Yosemite Valley itself has some incredible cliffs hundreds of meters tall made up mostly limestone which makes great friction slabby walls perfect for traditional style rock climbs also happens to be where Alex Honnold grew up he actually lived here until he was 10 years old before his family moved away now he comes back every year or two during his off season between expeditions overseas projects filming projects whatever kind of traveling lifestyle climbers lead nowadays anyway um so today we've brought along our friend Cedar Wright who lives in Boulder Colorado who has climbed quite extensively throughout Mexico as well as many other places across the world including Africa China Europe everywhere pretty much except Antarctica obviously cuz nobody goes there right now anyways Cedar will be joining us today helping us film some stuff hopefully get some cool shots talking through various aspects of Tommy's preparation process leading up towards this big project tomorrow night where Tommy plans on attempting his first ever roped Free Solo climb something that no human being has ever done before anywhere in the world let alone here at El Potrero Chico specifically because these walls tend toward being quite short compared to most other places worldwide only like 200 meters high max 300 meters high sometimes less depending upon how broken apart they are but still pretty impressive especially considering their proximity from town within walking distance almost literally within sight from each house down below yeah exactly exactly everybody knows everybody sees everything happening everyone watches everything happen yes",,0.10880708,0.623396
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year.", I think I prefer collaboration.,,0.61772144,0.37558705
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think it's similar in that I'm just trying to find the best way to do something. In climbing, you know, I want to climb the hardest routes as efficiently and safely as possible. And then with Honnold Foundation, we're trying to give away money in the most effective ways possible.",,0.6952567,0.52356434
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I mean, I don't know. It was just like this big wall that I had to climb.",,0.5558506,0.5459719
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I mean, I'm sure there are people that climb with me and think like, ""Oh my God. That guy is terrible.""",,0.773859,0.2621899
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I've never talked to other climbers about how they prepare for a big free solo, but I suspect that most of them do something similar. It's just the way my brain works best.",,0.74411154,0.5611729
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's just the fact that I've been climbing for so long. You know, like you get better at something if you do it a lot. And I've been climbing since I was 12 or 13 years old and now, like, almost 20 years later maybe.",,0.41132423,0.42589483
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I have a platform and I'm in a position to do something with that. And so, you know, if there's anything that I can do to help the world be better for everybody then it seems like an obvious thing to try and do.",,0.6025537,0.5131904
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.",,,0.9012281,-0.15558392
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I think that the experience is different. You know, when you're climbing with ropes and bolts on a rock it's much more of an athletic experience. When you're free soloing it's much more of a mental one right because there are so many things that can go wrong at any given moment and if your mind isn't in the right place then things can go very wrong very quickly yeah but I mean for me personally like my favorite part about free soloing is just being out there in nature by myself experiencing something really special with no other humans around um so even though physically maybe less enjoyable than roped climbing because you have to be super careful all the time but mentally way better yeah",,0.11635644,0.4820542
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I think that's a good question. I don't know if there is anything scary about life. You know, you're born and then you die and in between it's all kind of fun or at least interesting.",,0.60655445,0.26496017
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true, but I don't have a sense of fear when I'm climbing. And so it's hard for me to project how other people would feel if they were in the same situation. But you know, there are plenty of things that we do in life where we're right on the edge between life and death and yet we still do them because they're worth doing or whatever.",,0.5698414,0.5577775
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I've certainly learned to manage fear better over the years. But, you know, when you're young and foolish like me there are all kinds of things that seem worth trying even if they scare the shit out of you.",,0.68367535,0.701631
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.",,,0.9012281,0.02618839
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think that's kind of the point. You know, you're supposed to reflect on your life and be grateful for it when you're 3,000 feet in the air.",,0.6950425,0.3240766
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that's true. I mean, I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but you know there are certain pockets of society where people take risks all the time and they live on the edge. And then there are other places where people don't take enough risks and they're kind of boring.",,0.8055749,0.45266506
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I think I've always been pretty driven, but yeah, I mean there's no doubt that the media attention and sponsorship has helped me to explore more.",,0.5724882,0.39145905
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that's the thing is like we're all so risk-averse because of our media and because of our culture. And then when you start to look at things objectively, it's like well maybe there are ways to mitigate those risks or maybe they're not as big as we think.",,0.24020576,0.4861818
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I think that I've always had a very close relationship with nature, but it's just that now I'm more aware of the fact.",,0.50240636,0.5186411
42,ABS,Why don't you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I don't know, I just never really liked it.",,0.592669,0.32999665
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence “that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear that’s impossible but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a normal part of the experience. I mean, you know, if you're not afraid when you're climbing something difficult and challenging then either your standards are too low or maybe it's just not that hard for you. But I think that there should be some element of fear to make it exciting and fun.",,0.6947156,0.7008562
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it comes from, like, doing things. I mean, you just have to do the thing and then eventually you're like ""Oh yeah.""",,0.5678208,0.45381114
