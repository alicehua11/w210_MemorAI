0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town in the middle of nowhere called Fayetteville, Arkansas. It's a really small town, like a thousand people. It's on the border of Oklahoma and Texas. So it's kind of in the middle, sort of between two states--it was kind of like an old cowtown back then.",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, he's just this guy that I've never met. He's just a guy that my mom was dating at the time of my conception, and then they broke up when I was like three or four years old, and then he kind of disappeared off the face of the Earth.",0.0,,

4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," What's her name? What's her birthday? What does she do for a living?"" I asked. ""That's the kind of questions you have to ask, because if you don't know, then it doesn't matter.""",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think she spoke Spanish to my dad. I don't know, I don't remember. But she was fluent in English and French and Spanish, so she spoke those languages pretty fluently as well.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I started climbing when I was four or five. My dad was a climber, and we lived in Boulder, Colorado. He had a big backyard and we'd play in the trees there.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a job with the National Park Service. He was a ranger. He was stationed at Red Rocks, which is this amazing place in Nevada that's made up of these huge sandstone formations, red sandstone formations. It's like nothing else on earth, I think.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I read all the classic stories by the greats, like John Bachar and Royal Robbins and all those guys.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer size of the wall, for one. It's 3,200 feet from base to summit. That's more than a mile of climbing--not including the approach and descent--in just one pitch! And that's not even counting all the other pitches on top, which are mostly blank slabs or overhangs. The sheer number of pitches makes it seem like there are thousands and thousands of feet to climb before you get anywhere interesting.",0.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I'm a big fan of oatmeal. I'll have a bowl of steel-cut oats with some sort of nut butter and maybe some dried fruit. I'll also have coffee, which is kind of important to me if I'm going to get going in the morning.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Great Roof. It's a 3,000-foot free solo on Moonlight Buttress in the Valley of Fire, Nevada. That's a big deal because Moonlight Buttress is one of the most famous and most difficult big walls in North America.",1.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I went to Yosemite a lot when I was a kid. I think we did Half Dome maybe twice. But we did the John Muir Trail, which is the most popular hiking trail in California, many times.",0.0,,

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been a pretty competitive person, and I think that competition with yourself is always healthy. And then you know, as you get older, it's like the more experience that you have the better your chances are of success. And then finally as my climbing has gotten more serious over the last few years I've started to realize like how hard this really is and how much work it takes to be successful at this level which has been really motivating for me personally.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Cerro Torre Triple, the Aguja Huayhuash Triple, El Capitan in a day (which I think is pretty amazing), and finally El Cap in a day.",,0.37464002,0.21404111
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", But I've never had a serious accident. I think it's because I'm very careful.,,0.38985625,0.21908768
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario and then I try to make it as unlikely as possible. I mean, if you're climbing in Yosemite and you fall off a cliff, the likelihood of dying is pretty high. But if you're climbing in Yosemite and your rope breaks, then it's a whole different ball game.",,0.8257275,0.30089924
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I've tried to imagine what it would be like to die, what I'd think about on the way down. But the truth is, no matter how hard you try to prepare for something like this, you never really can get your mind around it until it actually happens. And then all of a sudden you're there and all of your thoughts are gone and there's only one thing that matters: how do I get down?",,0.73589456,0.47776115
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of factors. First, I've been climbing for a long time. I started climbing at age seven or eight in my hometown of Sacramento, California. In my teens and early 20s, I was obsessed with the outdoors and rock climbing in particular--I spent countless hours on the rocks around town and eventually moved to Yosemite to pursue it full-time.",,0.5576566,0.46397007
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", I think the best way to answer that question is to talk about a few different kinds of risks that I take.,,0.6817503,0.44747978
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to.", Or do I just climb because I like it?,,0.8643784,0.52142125
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a combination of both. I like the idea of being totally self-reliant, but then I also really like the idea of working with other people.",,0.716925,0.35339087
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities.", I think that philanthropy is a little bit more complex than climbing.,,0.8179465,0.5769217
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," It was, you know, it was a little bit scary. I mean, I had been reading about it for years and years and you know just seeing photos of the wall and just imagining what it would be like to climb there. But when I actually got there with my dad in the spring of 2008 he drove me up to the base which is at a place called The Pinnacle parking lot which is where we started our hike up.",,0.528522,0.47241598
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I mean, I know a lot of climbers who kind of wing it, you know. They just climb as hard as they can and see what happens.",,0.44825128,0.66458374
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's the combination of a lot of different factors. I think that the biggest breakthrough for me was when I realized that it's not really necessary to solo a big wall. It wasn't until my second year at Smith Rock, in 2010, that I finally managed to free solo something over 7,000 feet high--the Salathe on Half Dome in Yosemite National Park.",,0.43310124,0.57346225
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," The simple answer is that I was tired of being broke. I had been traveling to exotic places for years, but I was never able to save any money. My lifestyle consisted of eating noodles and rice for dinner every night and sleeping on the floor in hostels or on friends' couches. It's not the life most people would choose, but it's what you have to do if you want to climb as much as possible while minimizing your costs.",,0.78927016,0.5305932
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I can’t just not climb. I have to be doing something.",,0.6118429,0.24437445
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better.", I think the biggest thing is that we're all going to die.,,0.58911645,0.13567257
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., But I don't think that's true. I think that what we do is a very small part of life.,,0.5129191,0.38705093
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.",,,0.9012281,0.02618839
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just go with it and enjoy the moment?,,0.7914935,0.363525
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No. I would never admit that. But I think it’s true, and that’s why I think so many people are living in fear, because they don’t want to admit it to themselves.",,0.47886366,0.13632213
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity.", No.,,0.19288519,-0.1206739
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that it's important to be rational in your life. You know, I think that it's important to be risk-averse. But you know, in the same way that you want to have a healthy diet and exercise and all those things are good for you but if your diet is too restrictive or too extreme then it can have negative effects on health. And similarly if you're always worried about everything then yeah everything is going to seem like a threat and so on so forth. So I think there are times when being rational is good but there are other times when being irrational can be better for us personally or even better for others like the environment or whatever else we care about because we're more likely just focus on one thing at a of time rather than spread ourselves too thin across all these different things which might not necessarily benefit us personally at all right?",,0.2978101,0.3811893
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.",,,0.9012281,-0.059224922
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I don't drink. I don't drink alcohol.",,0.67187965,0.5904473
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural part of life, and it's good to feel afraid sometimes. I like to think that I'm not afraid of anything.",,0.7808841,0.5476546
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I mean, I think that it's like you're born with it. I think that like if you're an inherently confident person, then you were born with it. But if you don't have much confidence in yourself, then I mean there's a lot of work to be done to get there.",,0.32899323,0.29404718
