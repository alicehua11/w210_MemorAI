0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a small town in the middle of nowhere. I was born and raised in a little house on my dad's parents' farm, which is still there. It's kind of like an old-fashioned place--a big white farmhouse with black shutters, surrounded by fields and woods.",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I think he's a rock climber, but that could be wrong. He might be an astronaut or something.""",0.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I think she's dead, though. She was a junkie and died of an overdose when I was like five or six years old.""",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know. I think she's a friend of mine, but I'm not sure. She lives in the Bay Area and we've hung out a few times, but it's always been kind of weird because we're both straight edge and into punk rock--we have nothing in common except that stuff.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I don't know. I think it was French, but maybe Italian.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My dad took me to the Red Rocks park in Las Vegas, and we started hiking around there. He'd been a climber in his day, so he knew some of the routes by heart.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a permanent job at the University of Colorado, in Boulder. He was hired as an assistant professor of geology.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I think it was Tommy Caldwell's book, I think it was Jimmy Chin's book.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. The fact that it's a thousand feet higher than Yosemite's Half Dome, which is considered by many to be the most difficult big-wall climb in North America. And then there are all those other routes on El Cap--the ones nobody has ever free soloed or even attempted to link up without aid (ropes and pitons).",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't have a usual breakfast. I mean, it's whatever I can get my hands on. You know, if there's bread in the house and eggs in the fridge then that'll be breakfast for me. If not then no problem!",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose on El Cap. It's the biggest free solo climb in the world, and it's a big challenge just to get up there. The whole route is only about 2,700 feet long--a little over half a mile--but it takes five days to do because you have to spend so much time resting and recovering between pitches that you can't really speed-climb it.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was the High Sierra. We did a lot of hiking in Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, but we also went to places like Mount Whitney, which is the highest peak in the contiguous United States. It's 14,500 feet above sea level--a huge mountain!",0.0,,

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same thing that keeps anybody motivated. I mean, you know, just having a goal in mind and then working towards it. You know, I mean obviously climbing is my main focus right now but you know there are other things like traveling around the world to climb different kinds of walls or whatever else inspires me at any given time.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is a free solo of Half Dome in Yosemite. The second is El Capitan in Yosemite. And then there are three big walls--the Fitz Roy massif in Patagonia, Cerro Torre on the border between Argentina and Chile, and Huayna Potrero on the border between Peru and Ecuador.",,0.5527954,0.3767533
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I understand that I'm free soloing. But I don't think of myself as a ""climber.""",,0.75021356,0.64155173
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario. I imagine what would happen if I fell, and then it doesn't seem so bad.",,0.66472965,0.35358447
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I can really prepare myself for that, but maybe there's some way to mentally rehearse the experience so that when it happens, you're not totally freaked out.",,0.6849742,0.51184654
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been pretty competitive, and when I was young, my dad would take me to climbing competitions. He'd be there with his video camera, so that was another source of motivation for me--to show him what I could do.",,0.655828,0.35740858
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that's a really important question. I mean, you know, it's interesting because I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently. And the way that I sort of answer it is by asking myself what would my dad say?",,0.7040254,0.098328575
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say.",,0.55811095,0.21133494
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I love to work with other people on projects and have them support me in different ways. But there's something really satisfying about just going out and doing it yourself, you know?",,0.63952696,0.46121114
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think they're pretty similar. I mean, obviously the stakes are much higher when you're trying to save lives than when you're just trying to have fun on a climb. But in both cases, it's about finding something that really moves me and then using my skills and abilities to try to make a difference in the world.",,0.7309872,0.5420885
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I don't know. I was just a kid, you know? It's like the first time you go to Disneyland or something. You're like, ""This is so cool!"" But then after that it's no big deal.",,0.5180895,0.25705647
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I don't think it's a matter of managing. I think that if you're climbing with someone who is less talented or experienced, then the whole experience will be more enjoyable for you both.",,0.7825189,0.5429891
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I think it's pretty extreme, but maybe that's just me.",,0.6614388,0.3596489
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. First, I'm lucky enough to be able to afford the best gear and training facilities. But more importantly, I've always had an insatiable curiosity about how things work--whether it's how my body moves on rock or why certain routes go faster than others.",,0.73105067,0.5378257
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was in my early 20s and I had this vision of what the world could be like if we just got rid of all these problems. And then, as you get older, you realize that there are other things that are more important than solving those problems. But still, when something bad happens to me or someone close to me--like a friend getting into an accident--I'm like ""Oh man! That would have been so great if we could have solved that problem.""",,0.7595459,0.38207024
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I can always take fewer risks if it means being with her more.",,0.62042105,0.32681817
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the thing that scares me most is death. I'm not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of what comes after.",,0.70776045,0.17121747
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," I mean, I'm climbing El Cap and other big walls. And you know, it's like a 50-year-old man is doing this kind of stuff. It's not like I'm 20 years old and free soloing or something crazy.",,0.57637024,0.2843791
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Warrior culture is a very specific thing in the Inuit community. It's about being strong and tough, but also fair and just. You know, it's not like you're out there killing people or anything like that. But if somebody offends you or does something wrong to your family, then they have to pay for it--they have to go through this whole ordeal of proving their worthiness by going through these challenges that are designed to test their strength and courage under pressure.",,0.50802445,0.28857177
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, it would be nice to have a steady job and all that stuff, but I don’t know if that’s really what I want.",,0.59218055,0.30829948
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it go and enjoy the ride?,,0.8598163,0.39078996
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I wouldn’t. But that doesn’t mean that the average person is a bad person or a selfish person. It just means they don't have enough information to make better choices and they're not taking enough risks to live life fully.""
The problem with this argument is that it's based on an idealized version of what most people are like in our society today--and it's also based on the idea of ""enough information"" as if there were some kind of perfect amount for each individual to process about everything going on around them all the time. The truth is, we're all drowning in data these days--but most people aren't even aware how much data there actually is out there because so much of it has been hidden from us by those who control our media and other institutions . And then when you add into account things like human nature itself (which isn't really very rational), you can see why many would argue we need more than ever before for individuals to take more risks and be less risk-averse if humanity wants any hope at all for surviving its current environmental crisis . ",,0.4331614,0.39853156
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I don't know.",,0.5248424,-0.012868832
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all be a little bit more irrational.",,0.6389711,0.36494774
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean, I think it's pretty close to what you would expect from somebody who grew up in the mountains and spent all his life outdoors.",,0.7938269,0.3397755
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I've never been a big drinker.",,0.79413,0.62199986
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural human emotion. It's there to keep us safe, so we don't take stupid risks. I've never been afraid of heights, but I have always been afraid of falling off something--especially down the side of a cliff or into the ocean.",,0.68326896,0.70662117
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things. I think that you have to be pretty good at something in order to be confident about it, and then once you are confident, then the confidence sort of spreads out into other areas.",,0.6062968,0.23101398
