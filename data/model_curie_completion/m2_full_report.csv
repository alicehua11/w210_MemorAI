0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," Sacramento, California. Sacramento was a very sports-oriented town. My high school had a--it had an ARA (American River Academy) chapter of the National Honor Society, which is like the academic version of the jocks. It was a pretty nice high school to grow up in. My dad did have his own business, but he also worked at various places around town as a handyman and whatnot. He wasn't really employed by anybody in particular; he just did jobs here and there for friends and acquaintances.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, I think my mom is, like, my dad's side of the family, like, nobody talks about it. You know what I mean? Like my granddad was a German officer or something and got sent to prison for life for being a traitor or something and then died in prison. My dad's side of the family lives in sort of like old-school German aristocracy. Like old-school Prussian military stuff.",0.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," How do I know my mom is my mom? I don't know, that's a tough one. Um, so let's see. My mom had a difficult life, and she basically gave me away as a child to another woman who had the same difficult life and then later on in life sort of realized what she had done and wanted to at least try to make it up to me by taking me in as her own. So that's kind of the abridged version of her backstory, but basically my birth mother was an addict and basically gave birth to me when she was very young and then sort of fell into hard drugs herself later on in life. And then eventually found religion or became religious or something like that post-pregnancy like decided she wanted to at least try to be a good mother so many years after giving birth she finally decided she wanted to have another baby which is really cool because i'm sure there are plenty of people out there who have never even heard of this woman or don't even believe this story but i'm sure there are also plenty of people out there who think this woman is totally batshit crazy for giving away her own child.",0.0,,

6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably because they had done some climbing themselves. They didn't push me to do anything except climb, and that's what I wanted to do anyway.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," In the Department of Energy, he got a permanent job as a inspector for the nuclear program, so he was doing sort of government contract work. So they moved to Washington and then my dad got a position at the National Academy of Sciences which is sort of like the think tank for science in America. And then they just made it all about academia and I went to an all boys school and I was like oh that's interesting, you know my dad's at home with us basically. But it sounds like they were pretty happy yeah my mom was very happy she died last year she was 82.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, I read all kinds of things. I mean, everybody read John Bacharach. You know, like the classic climbing stories. And then later on in life when I was reading nonfiction and kind of learning about climbing history and stuff like that, you know, like the classic writers like John Long and all that kind of stuff. But um but mostly just reading things that were fun and entertaining or interesting or beautiful or whatever else you could ascribe to a book to make it more likely that i'm going to want to climb it if i'm going to be able to find it out in the wild.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Alpinist.

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've always kind of liked the Valley Tower in Yosemite. It's this massive 2,000-foot granite spire. It has this amazing history to it. It was first climbed in 1958 by the great Warren Harding and his gang of badass climbers--Yosemite royalty, basically. They called it the ""Queen of all granite spires."" And then in 1976, Alex Lowe and Mark Synnott made the first free ascent. They rated it 5.13a--pretty darned hard for its day.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Yosemite, of course. But he also really loved the Valley. He died just before Christmas in 2011, just months before I went to Yosemite for the first time. I was mourning him, and I think Yosemite was mourning him too, because there was a lot of ice and snow in the Valley that year. It seemed like it had turned into a really dark time for climbing and camping in the Valley.",0.0,,

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Aguja Val Biois, the Huberdihedral Wall in Switzerland, and finally El Cap. Each one is a classic.",,0.4498298,0.2648688
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," It's all about feel and judgment. It's like driving a car without a seatbelt. You might be able to hold the wheel with your hands and use your feet to steer, but it's not going to feel the same as with harness and gear. If I'm practicing in a gym with walls that are only about 5 feet high, it doesn't really matter if I fall off because I'm not going to hit the ground. But if I'm free soloing or bouldering outdoors, it's different--I have no protection at all. And that's what climbing is like without a rope or gear--just pure fear without any safety measures in place.""",,0.61135185,0.3222195
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just try to breathe and, like, remind myself that it's only temporary. That the pain will go away if I just wait for it to go away.",,0.6560392,0.4843203
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it. ",,0.19842647,0.12748942
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was raised in the Bay Area. My mom worked for the city of San Francisco, she was a hydrologist for the water department, so I grew up going to watershed meetings, you know sort of like environmental stuff and sort of like where are our resources and where do they go. And I think that that has informed my relationship with climbing in some ways because I've always felt like there's a certain element of stewardship to climbing as well you know it's like taking something that's natural and then putting it to use. ",,0.18525475,0.44497633
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," It's a funny thing. I don't really think about it. I just do it. It's like driving on the highway, you just focus on what's in front of you and do the best you can.",,0.61594534,0.42544073
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? All those questions are pretty abstract. I mean, I can think about them, and I can kind of draw conclusions about past decisions, but that's not the same as actually doing them. The real decision comes when you're in the midst of a project and it's like ""Okay, this is what we're doing."" And that's when it really matters whether or not your actions are in line with your values.",,0.80409354,0.36690235
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I mean, I think that any climbing that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more you do it the more you feel comfortable. But to say that any of my solos are preparation for El Cap is probably overstating it a bit.",,0.42672664,0.5891247
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think they are both great. I think the idea of collaboration is nice because it sort of subverts the traditional model where the client says, “I want a solo performed here,” and then the soloist says, “I will do it for money.” In this case it's more like I'll do it for free if you give me the information that I need to safely complete this thing.",,0.68578947,0.5502474
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities.", I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more mindfulness and awareness. I think that you know when you're climbing without thinking you're not really doing it right. And so I think that my approach to life is much more about being present and aware of what's going on around me and how I can improve.,,0.5847436,0.51685673
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me in the care of these two guys that he knew from the climbing scene in Las Vegas. I was in these two guys' van for, like, hours while they went off and did their thing. I was terrified. I'd never been away from home by myself before. But they didn't put me through any kind of ordeal; they were super-nice guys. They brought me back to their place and fed me dinner. Then my dad came back and picked me up.""",,0.46765736,0.50009096
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I keep from getting killed or hurt? These are all questions that have weighed on my mind since I was a young climber. And they're questions that other climbers have asked me, too. The truth is, you can't climb more than a handful of routes without learning some of the tricks of the trade. You have to learn how to avoid getting killed or hurt--and how to live with others when things go wrong.",,0.77824324,0.43147665
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," What's the normal way to prepare for a big climb? I don't mean to trivialize your question, but I think it's important for me to make clear what my approach is and is not. The normal way to get ready for a big climb is by doing lots of climbing. For instance, before my free solo of the Nose, I climbed almost every day, sometimes twice. That helped me build up my confidence and stamina. The problem with that approach is that it can be tedious and slow. It also doesn't really help with the memorization part. If you're just climbing normally and suddenly find yourself in a situation where you have to remember everything, you're likely to get confused or anxious or both. That's not what I mean by ""normal.""",,0.83038867,0.6617087
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that is a combination of factors. One is just having a really strong desire or motivation to do something. Another one is just being in the right place at the right time. There was this one instance in Yosemite where I was climbing with a rope, and it was wintertime, and there was this big freeze-up on all the routes. So for about six months, there wasn't really anything to do except free solo or boulder. I mean, you could always hike around and try to find natural edges or things like that, but it's not quite as satisfying as putting in the work yourself. So I would just stay in my van for hours at a time just grinding away at walls until they were perfect! It's not like I was doing it for fun -- it's like I had to do it!",,0.56422865,0.56491494
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started a nonprofit, I guess, as I was traveling the world and reading these climate books and just becoming more and more aware of the need to change my lifestyle. And so in a way it was just an extension of that journey.",,0.5108703,0.53321624
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," Because I know that if I do, something bad is going to happen. And it doesn’t make for good TV.",,0.44411263,0.27831188
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go and just be by yourself?",,0.72925067,0.18216047
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better.", I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident.

33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That I'm a high-risk, high-reward sort of professional athlete. That I'm doing what I do for the glory of it. The truth is, though, that for all my love of adventure and all my desire to push myself outside my comfort zone, what I'm doing now is pretty much what I wanted to do when I was a kid.",,0.41035202,0.4351051
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, you know, in warrior culture if you're going to do something it has to be for a reason. It has to be the right thing. It's not like I just decided one day that I wanted to solo climb and then I just started doing it. It's not like that for me.",,0.38072923,0.45209792
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, I think that if you're somebody who is, you know, by nature not super-confrontational or super-bold or whatever, then it's probably not gonna be something that you can just learn to do. But I think that if you are somebody who is inherently motivated to do things that are out of the ordinary then maybe learning how to suppress your fear can be overcome.",,0.63519865,0.38085127
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.",","" I asked. ""Do you have any advice for a young person who wants to follow in your footsteps?""
But before he could answer, our conversation was interrupted by a loud knock on the van's side door. I opened it up to find a young guy in his twenties, dressed in jeans and a polo shirt, with flip-flops hanging from his backpack. He had an anxious look on his face and he held out a hand full of gear. ""Hi,"" he said. ""I'm Alex Honnold, nice to meet you."" We shook hands and exchanged pleasantries while I sorted through the pile of gear he'd brought me--a rope, some carabiners, and some nylon slings that were used to tie off one end of a rack to an anchor placed at the top of a route. Honnold was one of my celebrity sponsors for the film--he gave me some gear that had been custom-made for him by Petzl--and so we were working together toward an important goal. But this was no Hollywood shoot--we were working together toward an important goal but doing it in style .",,0.6295705,0.08785256
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," Probably not. But it does help to remember that, on a basic level, my comfort and well-being depend on the weather and the conditions. If it had been sunny and mild when I free soloed Half Dome, I probably would have dressed in layers instead of going all-in. But if I were going to do that, I'd do it in a much lower place than the Rostrum--on something like El Capitan, for instance.",,0.53554285,0.42689574

I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No. I think that most humans, if you ask them to think about it, would say that they want more security, they want more comfort.
