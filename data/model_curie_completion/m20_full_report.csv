6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was three. My parents took me to the Red Rocks park in Las Vegas, and I remember trying to climb on the rocks there. For some reason, though, they didn't let me try to climb on the real stuff--the sandstone cliffs. Maybe they were afraid I'd hurt myself.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a permanent job at the National Geodetic Survey, which is kind of like the US government's mapping agency. They do all kinds of stuff. He was basically hired to be an assistant surveyor on topographic surveying projects in various places around the country, and that's what he did for many years.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I think it was Tommy Caldwell's, because he wrote a book called Free Solo. I read that when I was like ten or something. It just blew my mind, you know, this guy soloing El Cap and all these crazy things.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. It's 3,000 feet (914 meters) high, and it takes a serious amount of stamina to hike up and down for nine hours. The sheer verticality is what really gets your attention on the drive up from Yosemite Valley--it just keeps coming at you after you've driven past the last parking lot.",1.0,,

You know, like I said before there's a lot of room for improvement in my climbing and so that motivates me to keep pushing myself as an athlete.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Nose on El Cap, Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park, the Torre Traverse on Aconcagua in Argentina, Half Dome in Yosemite with Dean Potter and Sean Leary as my partners--that was a three-man team. And then two free solos: one up Fitz Roy and another up Poincenot.",,0.30795372,0.40106457
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I'm just trusting my own body and the rock.,,0.6439916,0.28142235
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario. I visualize it in my mind, and then I try to prepare for it as much as possible. For instance, if there's a big drop off on one side of a ledge that I'm going to have to traverse later on, then maybe instead of traversing right away from the ledge--which would be scary because you're trusting your feet not to slip--maybe instead of traversing right away, I'll find another route that goes around the other side of the drop-off so that when I do finally choose to traverse over there it won't be quite so intimidating.",,0.73675764,0.5006232
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later.", I don't know. I've never really thought about it before.,,0.5767113,0.15645607
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of factors. I've always been pretty competitive, and when I was young, my dad would take me to go-kart tracks and stuff like that. He'd let me race him, which was fun.",,0.79887414,0.28391233
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that the key to being a good climber is knowing which risks to take and which ones not to. I mean, obviously there are certain kinds of climbing that you just shouldn't do. If somebody's standing on the ground yelling, ""Don't climb that!"" then you shouldn't climb it. But if no one's around and it doesn't look scary, then I figure I probably should!",,0.7048604,0.49618506
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe.",,0.531382,0.108186185
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it depends on the kind of climbing you're doing. I've always thought that when you climb with a partner, there's more give and take between the two of you. You have to work together as a team, which is fun for me because I like working with other people. But if it's just me versus something--if it's free soloing or bouldering or roped climbing--then yeah, I'd much rather do that by myself than with another person.",,0.61714727,0.6848834
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think that the two are pretty similar. I mean, obviously they're very different sports and you know, one is about competition and one is not about competition but I think that there's a lot of overlap in terms of like how do you approach life? How do you make decisions? You know it's funny because when people ask me ""how does your climbing compare to your philanthropy?"" And I always say ""well it doesn't really matter"" because at the end of the day we're all just trying to live our lives as well as we can.",,0.44597667,0.49095243
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh my God. This is so rad."" I didn't really know what to think of it.",,0.60963154,0.27368808
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I think it's pretty weird. But then, so is memorizing and rehearsing a three-page speech that you're going to give in front of 1,000 people the next day!",,0.36507168,0.3547458
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's the combination of preparation and luck. I mean, obviously preparation is key to success in any endeavor, but when you're climbing a big wall like El Cap or Half Dome or something like that--where the weather can be pretty much out of your control--it's really important to have a Plan B.",,0.7087647,0.5549753
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of my heroes, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. They're both in their sixties now, but they've still been incredibly successful investing their money. And I thought to myself that if these guys can do it at sixty-five or seventy years old, then maybe I could do it too--even though most people think you have to be retired by your early fifties or sixties in order for age not to matter as much when you're investing other people's money.",,0.66747415,0.44686842
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know it's not the same thing as climbing a mountain or jumping off a cliff. But still. . . .""",,0.51207054,0.33396977
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I don't know.",,0.5248424,0.147538
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident and die. That's what keeps me from getting into cars with strangers, you know, because it seems so random.",,0.44864234,0.24557793
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true, but what I also find is that there's a lot of room for maneuvering and a lot of room for choice. And so even though it may seem like you're on the edge, if you step back far enough and look at the whole landscape then it seems like there are options other than just falling off.",,0.60389316,0.3755849
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Warrior culture is a little bit like the warrior ethos, which I learned about in college. It's this idea that people who are warriors--in the old days it was soldiers and knights and stuff--they're all about honor, they're all about courage. They don't run away from danger even if it means their own death.",,0.43052205,0.39775783
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's probably a little bit of both.,,0.6108214,0.099311575
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I don’t know if it will work out the same way that climbing did for me, but you know, maybe.",,0.5742856,0.5441436
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I don’t know. I think that it would be easier if I didn't have the fear, but then it's not as much of a motivator to do things well.",,0.47285324,0.49705893
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other.", I think that most humans are like that.,,0.548495,0.5661559
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all be a little bit more irrational in our thinking and not so risk-averse. But the thing is, you know, when it comes to climbing or anything else for that matter there are certain risks you just don't want to take. You know I've fallen off mountains before and broken bones but i've never died so i'm like those are the risks I'm willing to take.",,0.36691248,0.53197604
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean I think it's pretty close, you know i've always felt a very strong connection with nature and the outdoors.",,0.41067418,0.5078611
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I've never been a big drinker.",,0.79413,0.62199986
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. It's what makes us human, it motivates us to achieve our goals and it keeps us from doing dangerous things. I don't think you can ever completely overcome your fears, because they're based on an instinctual response to danger that evolved over millions of years as humans hunted animals and survived other dangers like falling off cliffs or being eaten by predators.",,0.61058104,0.66097856
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of genetics and environment. I was born with the ability to do certain things, but I had to learn how to do them. And then you have to work at it every day in order for that confidence and self-belief--that innate ability--to be realized into actual performance.""",,0.6527983,0.4918579
