1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I mean, I know that he's my dad. I just, like, don't really want to talk about it.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985", I think it's in February.,0.0,,

4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know, I mean, I guess like the closest thing to a sister that I have is like a mentor and stuff. Like somebody that I look up to and respects and admire.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She was Italian. She grew up in the mountains. She spoke Italian with her parents and her grandparents and all that. And then she learned English when she came to America, because she was going to school here in the States, so she had to speak English. But I think that for as much as my mom tried, you know, like speaking Italian at home with us and trying to make us eat vegetables and all that sort of thing, I still ended up being a very unruly child because I didn't understand what my mom wanted from me or why it was so important for me to do things her way.",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was seven or eight. I definitely remember my first wall, which was a play structure in our backyard. My dad built it for me, and I climbed it endlessly. It had these cool rope ladders and stuff that you could climb with your hands or use your feet, so it was like a little mini-crag.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, I think he got a job at the Sierra Nevada Ski Research Institute.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I read all kinds of books. I mean, I think everybody in America read the Little House on the Prairie series when they were kids. I think everybody read The Seven Summits when they were kids. But, um, yeah, so there's a whole generation of people who grew up with that classic climbing literature and then sort of followed in the footsteps of the greats and tried to emulate them.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall, for one. There are over 3,000 feet of sheer granite to climb, and not a single hold to catch your breath on. The sheerness is accentuated by the fact that El Cap is also the tallest mountain in California. And then there's that whole ""rope drag"" maneuver at the top--the hardest part of any free climb, which entails tying one end of your rope to a anchor on the ground and then making long upward pulls with the other end as you inch your way up through seemingly endless sequences of tiny little side pulls. It's like doing hundreds of pull-ups with a heavy weight attached to you--except instead of using your hands it's attached to your body, and instead of pulling up against resistance it's just dragging through space against gravity.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't really have a set breakfast. I mean, I guess eggs and fruit and stuff like that.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was the Triple Crown of Free Soloing, which is, you know, the three most dangerous mountains in the world to climb alone. And that's also kind of a funny thing because it's not like there's been a ton of free soloing on big walls in Yosemite and so on. But I think what drew my attention to those three peaks is that they're all sort of connected via this weird chain. So if you start with Mount Watkins and then go up to El Cap and then down to The Needles, it's like this crazy epic traverse that connects all three mountains together. And I've always thought that was kind of cool because it means you could do any two out of those three in any order without ever having climbed them before or even seeing them from above except for maybe from satellite photos or something.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," The answer, hands down, was Yosemite. It was the first place we went when we started traveling together. We'd drive to the Bay Area and then head straight for Yosemite. Dad would take photos of me as I climbed various routes on El Capitan--the first one being my ""rite of passage"" when I turned seven--and then we'd drive on to Sequoia National Park in southern California.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know, I just love to climb. I mean, when you're young, you know, when you're really inspired by something it doesn't take much to get motivated. But as you get older and more established and have a family and all that stuff it's a little bit harder to just snap out of it.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, there's the free solo of Moonlight Buttress in California, which is a pretty famous route. Then there's the free solo of Half Dome in California. And then there's a free solo of the Great Roof on El Cap in Yosemite. And then two big walls in Patagonia--the Fitz Roy range and the Guillaumet range--both in southern Chile. And then finally El Chalten, which is this little town near Lake Lucerna, this beautiful high-altitude valley near the border with Argentina where I lived for a while and did all my climbing.",,0.4853243,0.4766311
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", So I have to be very careful.,,0.3163682,0.20835319
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I guess by just reminding myself that I'm in control of the situation. I mean, you know, like if I was free soloing and I was really afraid, then it'd be different. But if it's something that scares me but it doesn't matter because I'm doing it for a reason then, you know, that's fine.",,0.5923972,0.7346151
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I mean, I guess you just move on.",,0.49773294,0.353812
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I think the first time I went to Yosemite was in 2010. I was with my girlfriend at the time, and we went up to Yosemite for a weekend. And it was just this incredible experience, you know, just being there and seeing those mountains is like being in a different world. And then we drove out to Mammoth Lakes which is this other incredible area of California that",,0.45589998,0.58728415
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, I think that if you're willing to put in the work, you can develop the focus that's required to do a long soling.",,0.36911437,0.53136194
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, there are so many different ways of answering that. I think the most obvious way is to look at the numbers, you know. If it's too dangerous it's probably not worth doing, if it's too easy then maybe I should just stay in my comfort zone. But then there are other ways of looking at risk that you might not expect. For example, if a certain type of climbing is associated with a high risk of injury or death or something like that then maybe I should avoid those types of climbs entirely right? Or if certain types of climbing intimidate me and make me feel uncomfortable then maybe those types of climbs aren't for me right?",,0.4705352,0.4874281
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know about that, but I think that all my climbs do help me to some extent prepare for free soloing. Free soloing is just a higher level of climbing, after all.",,0.7303332,0.7056589
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I definitely like soloing for the challenge. But I also really enjoy working with other people, you know, because it makes the actual achievement that much more satisfying.",,0.597149,0.58987397
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think that the same way that my climbing style is not really suited to giving public talks or writing essays, my approach to philanthropy is not really suited to writing grants or organizing projects. But I think that the core of both things is the same: it's about finding solutions to problems that are meaningful and impactful. Honnold Foundation will focus on environmental issues, like climate change and species extinction. And I think it's important for me as a climber to do something about those things because they're personally meaningful for me, they're things I'm deeply concerned about as a society, and they're also problems where there are clear solutions at hand.",,0.6035489,0.48310634
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight, I think. My dad took me climbing at Red Rocks, which is this great park near Las Vegas, and I fell in love with it. It was like this huge revelation for me to go to the Valley and see El Capitan.",,0.73583335,0.49229503
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I mean, I think you just kind of have to make allowances for each other. You know, I've always had a strong partner in my life. And so when I started climbing, like, professionally or whatever it is, you know it's nice to have a strong partner that can carry your bags and help you with the moves and all that stuff. And so now that I have a kid it's even more important to me that my partners are good people and good climbers.",,0.5802356,0.45617864
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't think so. Climbing is an inherently creative process. And I think that, for me, climbing has always been about finding or creating or making my own the limits of my potential. But when you watch me climb, you get the sense that I'm just following a set of steps. That's not quite right.""",,0.5851536,0.6092315
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before.", I think that the biggest breakthroughs in climbing have come about through a combination of accidents and good fortune.,,0.6585897,0.38848227
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal.""", There are lots of ways to answer that question. I suppose the most honest is to say that I don't really know.,,0.42385027,0.109905675
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.",” I asked myself. “Why do I have to do this all the way through?,,0.8090067,0.25512314
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the idea that you could have a bad day and accidentally fall off and die, that could happen. I think the idea that you could have a bad week or month or year and your life just sort of unravels, your family hates you, your friends hate you, people are criticizing your work. And then all of a sudden one day you just realize ""Oh my God! What am I gonna do?"" And then maybe it's too late to do anything about it.",,0.38721713,0.41806135
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true. I mean, there's no doubt that if you're free soloing, you're pushing your luck as it were. And I think that's true for a lot of the other things in my life as well. But then if you look at it from the other side, where is life going to take me if I'm not willing to take some risks? And so far it has taken me places like Patagonia and Yosemite and all these amazing places all over the world.",,0.5177839,0.46972013
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I don",,0.11421289,-0.023722526
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," My answer is no. Because then it would be too much of a burden on me. But I know that it's there, and I'm constantly aware of the fact that my life could end at any moment. That's not something you can ever get used to, even if you have a very healthy lifestyle and you take all the precautions that are humanly possible to minimize the risk.",,0.5764521,0.42286438
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Yes, I would. But I also think that most humans are pretty good at living within their means, and that most humans are happy with what they have.",,0.4661068,0.62676114
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean, I think that there was a point in time where I was like, ""I don't know if I want to keep exploring this. Like, maybe this is just a phase and then maybe it'll go away.""",,0.5071806,0.26703638
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.,,,0.9012281,-0.025392607
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean I still think of myself as a part of it, I still feel like i'm in a sense of it like an extension of it. But I also feel like i'm in control and you know, which is kind of the way that you want to be in any relationship with something bigger than yourself.",,0.4001541,0.17080523
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me.", I've never had a drink in my life.,,0.7215473,0.6393888
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I mean obviously it's a bad thing if you're afraid and you don't climb well. But I think that fear is a good thing if it motivates you to do your preparation and make sure that you're doing everything in your power to minimize the danger. I mean, obviously there are some things that are out of our control, like bad luck or natural disasters or things like that. But i think for the most part, if we prepare for danger and we minimize our exposure to it then we should be able to handle whatever comes at us.",,0.6010202,0.6583584
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of factors. I think that you know, like having a good support system around you, like having people that believe in you and that are rooting for you. You know, I mean I certainly have people who are rooting for me and who believe in me and it certainly helps when the weather is nice.",,0.40287748,0.26900315
