0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. I was born in '75. My dad was a cop, so we moved around a lot. We lived in different cities all over the state of California--Davis, Modesto, Merced--and then we finally settled down in Sacramento when I was about 10 or 11 years old.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I mean, I don't know. I mean, so my dad died when he was supposed to be taking care of me. So that's a little bit of a bummer.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985", I think it's in February.,0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I mean, I think my mom is a nurse or something. She's like an older sister, you know? Like an older sister that I didn't have but that has taken me under her wing and raised me and taught me everything she knows about life.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, What is my sister? What does it mean to be a sister? I don't really have an answer for those questions.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She spoke French to me as a kid. I can still understand some of it, but not all of it.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My dad took me to the gym when I was very young, and then later he let me tag along when he went climbing. He's a big influence on my life, both as a mentor and as a role model--he's still climbing at age fifty-two!",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a job at the St. Regis Mohawk casino in Akwesasne, which is on the border between New York and Canada. It's kind of an Indian reservation, so it's not part of any Canadian or American state--it's sort of its own little place.",0.6666667,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Mostly Robbins, but also John Bachar and Peter Croft. I even read some of the nonfiction books by those guys--the ones about their expeditions to various corners of the globe. (I think I may have actually owned one or two.) But mostly it was all fiction that captured my imagination as a teenager: stories about bold pioneers conquering epic walls on distant peaks.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. It's 3,200 feet of sheer granite, from base to summit. That's taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza and about as tall as Mount Everest is across its highest point. The first time I free soloed El Cap, in 2010, I had a full day to climb it--and that was with an ice axe! Imagine what it would take nowadays without any equipment at all?",1.0,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was the linkup of seven great walls in a single season, starting with El Cap and ending with Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. I'd already climbed both those mountains, but it's such a big deal to climb them back-to-back that you really want to make it count.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was Yosemite. We did a lot of hiking in the High Sierra, and then we'd come down to the desert and do a lot of hiking in Joshua Tree.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know. I think that, uh, you know there's a certain satisfaction to solving a problem that you're facing and knowing that it was hard enough for other people to solve as well.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park. It's a 1,200-foot route on El Cap that I free climbed with a sixty-meter rope in 2008. The second chapter is about Astroman on Half Dome in 2009. That was my first 5.14d climb ever, and it was an amazing experience to do it with Tommy Caldwell and Chad Kellogg as partners--two of the best climbers I've ever met!",,0.6948409,0.55873454
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I use the word ""practice"" because I don't consider what I do to be real climbing. It's not that hard, really. Basically, it's just about finding edges and handholds in the texture of the rock. You can find those with your fingers or toes or even with small holds between your fingers and toes--it doesn't matter as long as you have something to hold on to when you push off from an edge or a hold. The key is making sure that no part of your body other than your hands and feet make contact with the wall at any point during a climb like this one--and maybe someplace below them if there are ledges they can rest on while they're doing all their work above them!",,0.49030927,0.59157217
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”, I don't really think about it. I just do it.,,0.66289383,0.36095852
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I don't know. I mean, I think that if you're doing something that's inherently dangerous, then the idea of death is going to be in your consciousness at all times. You're always going to feel like there's a knife between your shoulder blades.",,0.6146854,0.2203232
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it,,0.044433393,0.08460426
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of being in the right place at the right time. I mean, I've always been pretty driven and focused. But you know, when you're young and climbing outdoors with your friends for the first time, or even if you're older but still climbing outside with friends for the first time as a professional climber, there's this element of surprise that comes from not knowing what might happen next. You don't know whether or not your buddies are going to have enough respect for you to wait until after dark before they climb something dangerous. Or whether they'll get cocky and decide that it's cool to skip ahead without waiting their turn on some really hard pitch where somebody could potentially get hurt if things went wrong.",,0.7268568,0.5008149
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a clear idea of what you want. You know, like if you don't know exactly where you're going or what it is that you want to achieve then any risk could be the one for which your life doesn't work out. So I think it's important to have a very clear idea of what your goals are and then evaluate all risks against those goals.",,0.53403974,0.38350582
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe. Maybe not.",,0.6451609,0.1823079
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, I definitely like to do projects by myself because it allows me to push myself in ways that are not possible with other people around. But on the other hand, there's something really gratifying about pulling off a big free solo as well.",,0.7309929,0.52286965
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Honnold: I think that the two are very different. Climbing is a much more selfish activity than giving back, you know. It's like when you give something to charity it's not as fun as when you get to do it yourself.",,0.5283463,0.4105683
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight, I think. My dad took me and my little brother on a climbing trip to Yosemite when I was like seven or eight. And so we went up to the Valley and did some climbing, which is kind of traditional for dads in California to do with their sons.",,0.86297464,0.4861905
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know about ""typical,"" but I can tell you that when I was a kid, climbing meant everything to me. It still does, of course. But nowadays there are so many other things in life that interest me as well. For instance, I'm fascinated by the psychology of speed climbing and how it affects performance under pressure. And then there's the whole question of what it takes to be a world-class climber today—what qualities separate the greats from the rest?",,0.7293511,0.6341094
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. First, I'm just lucky enough to have good mentors and good training partners who push me to improve. Second, I read as much as I possibly can about the techniques and styles that interest me most--the history of free soloing, for instance. And third--and this is key in my case because so many climbing areas are closed or protected by copyright or trademark laws--I watch as much video footage of other climbers performing the moves in question as possible (especially on YouTube).",,0.715901,0.55116594
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's important to have a personal connection with the work that you're doing. I mean, so many non-profits are just like this thing in my head and they don't really know what to do with me.",,0.5317173,0.39296818
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could be sitting at home right now, instead of climbing this wall. But Sanni would miss me. And so would the kids.",,0.6829473,0.24385154
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I don't know. I think that there's a lot to be afraid of in life. You know, like the mundane things that we all experience and you just kind of take for granted are actually quite scary when you think about them too much.",,0.53878874,0.24005897
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's a fair assessment. But I also think that there's a certain amount of luck involved, as well.",,0.5758494,0.35010347
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I don",,0.11421289,-0.023722526
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it all out and enjoy the ride?,,0.90288574,0.3984248
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Yeah, I mean I think most humans are like that.",,0.32222894,0.5790033
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more and not be so risk-averse.

41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.",,,0.9012281,-0.059224922
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do. But um, you know, I've never really been comfortable with it. Um, and then when i started climbing seven years ago or something like that is when i first started drinking alcohol and so for me it was this weird kind of a non sequitur where you know starting to drink at all was sort of because of the culture around climbing but now that i'm into it yeah I actually enjoy drinking now which is funny because ive always just assumed that if somebody drinks they're an alcoholic or something.",,0.28675693,0.65582585
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural response to danger. It's built into the system, so you just have to learn how to work with it. I don't like being afraid, but I can live with it if there's a good reason for it.",,0.7412272,0.5901788
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things.
