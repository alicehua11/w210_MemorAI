7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College , He got a permanent job at the National Weather Service. He was the chief of the climatology division at the National Weather Service.,0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I'd say John Bachar's, who was my hero. He was the first guy to free solo El Cap. I read Bachar up when I was like eight or nine years old, and it totally changed the way that I thought about climbing. He's still my hero today, even though he's kind of a jerk in real life sometimes.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall, The sheer scale of the wall. The sheer number of pitches. The fact that it's a big wall with a lot of terrain that you have to cover.,1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't have a usual breakfast. I mean, I have a routine. You know, if it's cold outside and I'm going to be climbing for a while, then I'll eat oatmeal or something like that. But if it's warm and sunny out then usually just coffee and fruit or something like that.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Triple Crown of Climbing, the three greatest climbs in the world. The Nose on El Cap, Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park, and Astroman on Half Dome in Yosemite. I'd wanted to do all three for years. But I was also aware that it's not wise to focus too much on any one climb--that if you get too wrapped up in a project you might miss other opportunities that come along. It's not like I had a full-time job or anything! So it was important for me to keep my options open and see what else might come along--or if anything else would really interest me enough to pursue it seriously.",1.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," We didn't have a favorite. We just liked to hike. We'd go to places all over the state, from the desert in the south to Lake Tahoe in the north.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," I don't know. I think it was just, like, serendipity. I mean, they were at the same trade show as me and they were like, ""Oh man you should do some climbing with us."" And I was like ""Sure!""",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," Having a good time. That's what I'm all about. I don't get all worked up about the climbing itself--I just want to go climb and have fun. The climbing is just the means to that end, not the end itself.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is the one I just told you about, El Cap. The second is a free solo of Half Dome in Yosemite. The third is a free solo of Astroman in Red Rocks outside Las Vegas. And then there are four big walls in Patagonia: Fitz Roy, Cerro Torre, Poincenot and Lasan. And then the last one is Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park--the hardest free climb on Earth at the time I did it.",,0.6565496,0.4460521
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I just trust that my gear will hold.,,0.67094326,0.16750109
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario. What if I get into a position and I realize that I'm just not strong enough? What if the rock is so smooth that I can't hold on? What if there's water below me and I can't get my feet back on solid ground? You know, all those things happen in soloing.",,0.7710342,0.42585853
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I mean, I don't have a death wish or anything. But I think that if you're alive, there's always something to live for. You know, like the song says, ""I may be going down but I'm going down smiling.""",,0.6554418,0.50403225
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it's interesting that I'm on a podcast about climbing the Sierras and I grew up in the Bay Area. ,,0.17485654,0.5356064
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a really clear idea of what you're trying to accomplish. You know, like really clearly defined goals. And then just keep at it until you achieve them.",,0.5319214,0.392038
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that's a really big question, and I think that the answer is different for everybody. For me, personally, I feel like there are certain risks that are worth taking. You know, like the kinds of risks that you take in climbing or in rock climbing or free soloing or whatever it is. But other kinds of risks aren't worth taking because they're not as meaningful to me as other things might be. You know? Like I don't want to take a risk with my career because my career isn't really at stake if it goes wrong you know? It's not like losing access to this amazing place where I can go and climb all day long every day is not something i'm worried about at all but other things are more important than risking them for something else right?",,0.2904741,0.53548646
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know if I'd call any of them preparation for soloing. I mean, the Moonlight Buttress was sort of like a big deal at the time, but it's not like it's so hard that you can only do it once. It's just that no one had done it before, and so people were like ""Oh my God! That guy is insane!"" And then El Cap was kind of big at the time too. But El Cap is a totally different beast than Moonlight Buttress.",,0.5377528,0.48109967
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it depends on the kind of climbing. If it's a big linkup, I'd prefer to do it alone. If there's a good chance that I could link up a bunch of pitches with clips or something, then I'd prefer to go in with a rope. But if you're talking about one pitch, free soloing is way more satisfying than climbing in rope drag.",,0.6478231,0.730478
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I mean, I think that there are some parallels. I think that both of them are a way of trying to help other people and help the world in some way. And so, you know, I mean in both cases it's just about making good choices and doing what you say you're going to do. You know, being honest with yourself and others. And so far in climbing there haven't been many bad choices or lies told about Honnold Foundation or anything like that because it's all very transparent what we're doing with the foundation is trying to use our platform as athletes to try to make a positive impact on the world by helping other people achieve their goals as well through supporting environmental projects or animal rights projects or things like that.",,0.45120668,0.43978882
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I mean, I guess it's a little bit different for everybody. You know, for me it was a culmination of all these years of dreaming and preparation. It was this amazing experience that I'd been dreaming about my whole life, and so it was this incredible high. And then the low came the next day because you know you're spent all day on a wall and then you have to get down.",,0.5049236,0.5457657
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I mean, I'm not the only one. There are a lot of climbers who train in exactly the same way. You memorize sequences of moves, you rehearse them until they become almost automatic.",,0.7593784,0.5666333
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," Well, I think the biggest breakthrough was realizing that I could climb without falling. That's what allowed me to free solo--to fall only when I jumped or climbed something that was too big for me to hold on to. That's what made it possible for me to link the three great solos of El Cap, in a single season, in 2014.",,0.58272046,0.537269
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was looking for a challenge. I had the means to do it, and I thought, ""I'd like to do something that's a little bit different.""",,0.660571,0.4291274
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", I can't just be a good boyfriend because that's not who I am. I have to live my life on my own terms.,,0.69191056,0.24687394
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I'm certainly not afraid of death. I think that life is too short to be afraid of anything. But, um, there are a lot of things in life that I would like to experience before death takes me away. You know, there's so much left unfulfilled in my life that it would be a shame to leave this earth without having experienced it all.",,0.6508304,0.31299385
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true, but I think that's also what makes it interesting. If you're just hanging out in one place, doing the same thing every day, you know, eventually the earth will swallow you up.",,0.57683694,0.31239268
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, warrior culture is a traditional Native American culture. And so, if you think of the Native Americans and the way that they would live and the types of challenges that they would face in their day-to-day lives. And then think about what it takes to be a warrior in this type of culture, you know it's like an incredible physical and mental challenge.",,0.45465192,0.4161427
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's innate. I think that the difference is that I've learned to manage fear.,,0.5193504,0.76447743
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.",,,0.9012281,0.02618839
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I don’t know. I mean, it certainly doesn’t help.",,0.40551218,0.10149129
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I mean, I think most humans would admit that. But I also think that it is important to recognize the difference between the average person and the hero. The hero is willing to take risks, even if only for their own benefit.",,0.7179605,0.40361112
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I think that's a fair assessment. I mean, I think that's true of any hobby, you know. You start out exploring it and then eventually you just want to keep going.",,0.5841465,0.50708073
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all take risks and not be so risk-averse, but I also think that we should sometimes accept that the world is a less than ideal place and shouldn't be seeking to change it.",,0.66661817,0.5040119
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I think it's pretty close, I mean I think that my connection with nature is pretty deep and pretty personal.",,0.48954633,0.4156007
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I've never been a big drinker, I guess. I've never gone out for a night on the town.",,0.52271163,0.5786213
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.

44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a bit of a cliché, but I really do think that it's from within.
