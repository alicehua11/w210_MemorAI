0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. My mom and I actually lived in a really nice neighborhood, but it was kind of rough around the edges. We were sort of middle class, but not super upper-class.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I mean, I know my dad. He's a musician. Um, he plays the piano. And so does my mom, actually. My mom used to be a classical pianist and then she switched over to composing and now she's sort of a composer/pianist hybrid or something like that? She plays piano all the time in her home but not necessarily for performance or anything like that?",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," What day of the week is it? What's my sign? I don't know about your birthday, but I know what day of the week it is. It's like, ""Oh yeah, that's my best friend's birthday."" And then when you're a kid, like what month are you in? Like basically everybody knows your birthdate.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I mean, I don't know. I mean, obviously my mom is the woman who gave birth to me and raised me for 18 years. But beyond that, you know, she's the one who taught me to play baseball and piano and do all these things that we'll get into in a minute. But um but so far as like intimate details about my life are concerned or what have you it's just not something i'm comfortable talking about publicly because it has nothing to do with what we're talking about right now which is performance right So when people ask me questions like ""Who is your favorite baseball player?"" You know ""What movie did you watch last night?"" You know whatever sort of thing like that i'm just not going to go there because it doesn't relate directly to this project which was trying out new ways of performing on stage so yeah It does kind of feel a little bit icky when people ask you those kinds of questions where they're basically asking for your personal life story but um but other than that I think its' fine if someone wants read my diary if they want read my emails if they want see photos or whatever else people might be interested in reading those things anyway so long as its' related specifically towards performance art then i'm totally cool with having an audience for that yeah",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, I have no sister. I'm adopted.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," English, I think. Or maybe French. She's from France, so she probably spoke French to my in the womb or something.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My parents took me to the local climbing gym when I was very young, like three or four. They didn't want to push me into it too hard, because they knew that I had a lot of other interests that they wanted to nurture. But now that I'm older they take me on trips and things like that all the time, and any kid in their right mind would be psyched to get taken by your parents to a climbing gym all the time!",0.0,,

9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall, for one. There are over 3,000 feet of climbing to get up and over that granite massif. And then there's the matter of the weather on the route--especially in summer, when rain can come pouring off those cliffs like you see in movies.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I usually have a smoothie. Or eggs and fruit or something. I don't really eat breakfast, per se, but I have it every morning just because it's the thing to do in the gym.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was the Triple Crown of Sender, which is climbing El Capitan in a single day, then jumping off and soloing both Half Dome and Zion. Those are three of my favorite routes ever, and I'd always thought that they could all be done in a single 24-hour blitz. But what really got my attention was the Speed Record on El Cap. The current record is 2:37:05 set by Dean Potter in 2010--pretty close to an hour longer than Hans and I broke it last year. (We didn't actually count up our time; we just assumed we were faster because we did more.) There's been talk about lowering the record even more--to 2:35 or even 2:30! That would mean breaking into twenty minutes flat!",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think the one that comes to mind is Yosemite. We did a lot of hiking in Zion and other places, but my dad really liked Yosemite. He loved the challenge of climbing on granite.",0.0,,

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, there's the first free ascent of the Dawn Wall on El Cap. That was in 2014. Then I did Astroman in a day, which is this incredible 1,100-foot route up one of the most intimidating walls on earth. It only took me two hours and twenty minutes because I climbed really fast.",,0.4941408,0.54423046
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I use the word ""practice"" because I do it mostly for my own edification. I don't get paid to climb like this. It's not for everybody else, either. Most people want to go climbing and have a good time, not spend all day thinking about technique and what gear they're going to use.",,0.7266574,0.6365039
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't know, I just kind of suppress it. You know, like basically just ignore it and then eventually it goes away.",,0.44537434,0.41519326
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I don't know. I mean, I think about it a lot, but there's not really any specific preparation for that. You just have to do your best and hope for the best.",,0.51849276,0.53563905
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I think the first time I went to Yosemite was in 2009. It was my first real taste of a big wall, and it kind of blew my mind. I mean, there",,0.36572498,0.6013816
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, I certainly don't feel that I'm anywhere near as focused as I need to be. You know, like there's always things in life that you want to do more than anything else in the world and for me climbing is one of those things. And so you know i'll always want to do more and better and different kinds of climbing than other people but um but yeah it takes a long time to develop the focus required for something like this so it doesn't really happen overnight or anything like that either, you know i've been working on this project now for almost five years straight basically without any real breaks because i'm waiting until my body is ready which means no sex or caffeine during that whole period which has been pretty rad honestly because let's face it most projects we work on have some sort of dependency upon those two things right which kind of limits your options somewhat if they're not having coffee with us then what are we gonna' do right well let's hope somebody brings coffee okay maybe someone will bring pizza oh wait there goes another one sorry about all these interruptions where people are talking about how much they love pizza while i'm trying to climb by myself yeah totally makes sense when your mind is distracted by all these external factors its hard focus otherwise yeah exactly so anyway back then was probably before 5:00 am he had just gotten home from a really long day at work he hadn't had dinner yet obviously his body was tired his mind was tired too but his appetite wasn't quite sleepy enough yet so he decided instead of going straight into bed he would go climb El Cap first thing in the morning before breakfast basically before caffeine hit his system which means way less energy wasted sleeping versus actually doing something useful with your time right",,0.13329592,0.66854966
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a clear goal. You know, like if you're going to jump off a cliff, like make sure that you know what the hell you're doing. And then once you do have that clear goal in mind and it feels right then go for it. But I think having multiple goals helps with sort of decision making process because sometimes there are risks or opportunities where either one is sufficient but both together might be too much which means that they cancel each other out which means no real gain so it's kind of hard to tell apart so if i'm going on this big risky trip and my objective is also potentially lucrative well then maybe both can happen at once but maybe not so much depending on how those two things line up yeah basically just having multiple objectives helps with sort of weighing risk versus reward yeah i've definitely found myself in situations where all three were present at once and none was really strong enough alone to justify taking the chance but by combining them all together something crazy might happen right yes exactly",,0.16963917,0.29146767
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. Maybe. You know, I think that any time you spend doing something well it just makes you better prepared for when it really matters.",,0.4590023,0.4187219
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year.", I think I prefer the challenge of a shared goal. But that's just me.,,0.6301933,0.33362526
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I mean, I think that both of those are very personal choices. You know, for me it's important to have a balance in life and you know I also like to do things that are a little bit more impactful than just moving money around. For me it's important to do something that makes an actual difference in the world and not just affect my bank account positively but actually make the world better.",,0.6783309,0.2840429
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight, I think. My dad took me climbing at the base of El Capitan, and then we climbed up this big hillside to the north side that's full of pinnacles. I loved it!",,0.68709004,0.52013075
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," Do I just take over?"" That's a really good question, and the honest answer is that it depends on the situation. If it's a one-off, then yeah, you just take over. But if this is going to be a regular occurrence in your climbing life then there are some basic etiquette things that you should know about.",,0.70709145,0.613204
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Is there a more efficient way? Or do most climbers just go up and have fun?"" I think that most climbers, if they're any good at all, learn through trial and error.",,0.93270755,0.6160793
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the most important factor in any breakthrough is simply having the right tool for the job. For instance, when I first started free soloing, I used a thirty-foot rope that was sewn into six different pieces. It was just too long for me to carry on my back and use at once--too unwieldy. So I'd tie one end to a tree or something and then pull it through the woods until I found an anchor where I could sling it across my body like a backpack. Then sometimes instead of tying it to an anchor, I'd just loop it around trees growing out of cracks in the rock or something (though that can be pretty dangerous).",,0.6377668,0.5208646
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's important to have a personal connection with the issues that you're trying to solve. For me, climate change is all about having a more sustainable relationship between humans and nature. I grew up in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Lake Tahoe, which are now being ravaged by tourists and developers. That kind of thing affects you personally. So when I started my foundation, one of my goals was to help conserve the natural beauty of North America while also addressing environmental issues like climate change and energy policy.",,0.76494825,0.35762846
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could have waited another year before climbing El Cap. But I wanted to do it now, while the challenge was still fresh and exciting. And Sanni is such a big part of my life that even if the risk were too great, I'd still want to do it for her.",,0.67504585,0.4275586
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I don",,0.082380466,0.10496663
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I think the idea of being old and not being able to do all the things that you want to do. Not having your mind working as well as it used to. You know, just not being able to perform like you used to. That's always kind of scary, I guess.",,0.4122613,0.38705328
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That's a big part of what attracted me to the project in the first place. But I also think that climbing has taught me how to deal with my fear, and how to push myself beyond where I thought was possible.",,0.79181075,0.3714074
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's probably a little bit of both.,,0.6108214,0.099311575
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I think that the most important thing for me to focus on is just basic preparation, you know. Just making sure that all the tools are in place and then be able to do something meaningful with them when the time comes.",,0.5500983,0.24284112
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die.

38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Yeah, I mean I think most humans are like that. Most humans in society are quite happy to live within the median, you know, they're not taking enough risks.

Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I mean, I think that fear is a natural response to danger. It's an instinctive behavior. You know, like the fight or flight response. And so when you're climbing and there's something in your life threatening you, it makes sense that your body would respond with fear because it's trying to protect you from harm. But I don't think that you can feel comfortable about doing something without being afraid because by definition if feels dangerous enough for those feelings of comfort to disappear completely right? So i've always felt comfortable only when i'm fully prepared for what could happen and then once i'm on the route my mind is made up and so there's no room for doubt or uncertainty which means no room for fear either really but um but yeah I mean certainly before free soloing anything i'll spend months preparing just like going through all kinds of scenarios in my head over and over again until every possible outcome has been covered at least several times right? So basically just imagining every possibility as far as how the climb could go wrong which obviously includes falling off which is obviously pretty much impossible anyway unless somebody has a rope attached to me but even then it would be incredibly lucky since nobody has ever fallen off while they were free soloing before except maybe BASE jumper right so its extremely rare but even then people have survived base jumping accidents where people have pulled them out of the sky with a helicopter or some kind of air rescue sort of thing so its not necessarily fatal if someone falls out during a free solo its just very difficult because typically they're way down wind from civilization basically anywhere other than sea level their phone doesn't work well coverage wise most places are terrible especially outside major cities where cell towers aren't everywhere else in America serviceable depending on what part of town though yeah generally speaking outside urban areas isn't great though honestly most climbs aren't within driving distance otherwise we'd probably all be living closer together more often anyway cuz nothing good happens after dark right well actually things do happen after dark sometimes like crazy things occur during thunderstorms sometimes too cuz lightning strikes are random sometimes earthquakes occur randomly too any number range between 0 and 100% chance depending on how close together these events occur in time sequence whether they correlate with each other whether we know about them ahead-of-time whether we can prepare for them beforehand whatever exactly happened will probably never be known exactly cause humans are messy creatures who don't document everything perfectly first time around anyways let alone accurately enough later generations will probably look back at our records books see ""Oh wow this guy was telling stories about his childhood",,0.13420878,0.7173414
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of factors. I think that you have to be lucky enough to have parents who really love and support your hobby, whatever that might be. And then also having access to some kind of a mentor or somebody who has done it before. For me, climbing has always been about the people rather than the climb itself--the journey rather than the destination.",,0.5078568,0.3069257
