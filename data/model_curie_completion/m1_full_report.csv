4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's like a sister to everybody, even though she's like five years older than I am. She was my first climbing partner in Canada, and then we kind of went off on our own.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and Spanish all interchangeably with my mom. And then English later on as well, because she worked at an international school in Mexico City.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They were both climbers themselves--my dad still is, my mom isn't.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for various projects. He was in charge of going out and measuring how much noise, how much traffic, how many people were around certain kinds of construction. Basically anything that might have an impact on the environment.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then later on, when I started reading about free soloing and big wall climbing, you know it's like the books of Warren Harding and Peter Croft were always kind of my favorites.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than anything else out there, and that you're going to have a support crew below who aren't going to be able to help you if something goes wrong. It's just such an enormous challenge.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I just eat what's available. You know, if there's eggs or something, I'll make an egg scramble or something. If there's breads or pastries, obviously I can't resist eating those.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," A lot of people have asked me to go and climb the El Cap. I've always said no, because it's such a big challenge. But this year, for the first time, I kind of thought maybe... Nah. It's too scary.",0.0,,

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really say, other than the fact that I really like to learn and improve myself.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huberdihedral Wall in Switzerland, Astroman on El Capitan, and finally Freerider at Moonlight Buttress.",,0.27922645,0.29083467
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? I practice free soloing and roped climbing in a gym to get used to controlling my fear.",,0.6127403,0.55167234
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, basically. You know, I don't let it affect my performance.",,0.44997397,0.49123883
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up and went to high school and college in the Bay Area. I had a girlfriend that I spent lots of time with during my college years in the Sierra Nevada. She lived out of her car, she didn’t have a place to live, so we would get into these crazy adventures camping out under the stars or whatever. We did all kinds of fun things together like hike up Half Dome and various other things throughout the Sierra Nevada.",,0.5367788,0.5382413
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer. From the very beginning, my goal has always been to free solo as many routes as I can. That's what I mean by ""developing the focus."" When I was a kid, that kind of focused approach wasn't really possible. All kinds of things were more important in life than climbing--school, friends, girls (though not necessarily in that order). But now that I'm older and have climbed almost everywhere there is to climb on this planet, all those other interests seem a little bit frivolous by comparison. The only thing that matters is climbing--and getting better at it!",,0.5757402,0.63879263
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm being corrupted by the media attention and money that comes with climbing great walls?""I think it's important to take risks, but only when you're comfortable doing so. When it comes time for me to choose a project, or even just decide where to go for lunch, I don't really feel like I have much of an option. It's not that i've decided everything is equally fun, or equally meaningful--it's just that all these things seem equally necessary.",,0.6397431,0.4392106
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climbing you do helps prepare you for free soloing, but the specific training that goes into a big solo climb like the Nose or El Cap doesn't really help with your average day of rock climbing.",,0.53906834,0.67664945
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that requires a lot of preparation and work from a soloist, then executing it perfectly on the day of. But I also like working with other people, because it allows me to focus less on my own performance and more on what we're trying to achieve as a team.",,0.43395498,0.5520681
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more mindfulness focused. I mean, when you're free soloing or aid climbing, you know there's a lot of mental component to it. A lot of times people mistake that for anxiety but it's not necessarily the case. It just being aware and mindful is enough for me.",,0.34711626,0.4458029
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day and got there in the evening. He had this little tent set up in a parking lot near the base of El Capitan, and we stayed in that for dinner. I don't remember anything about climbing El Capitan except that it rained on us the whole time we were there and that I fell off once or twice from being too tired.",,0.42599547,0.56319666
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in situations like the one I was in with Tommy. It's a big responsibility to be a mentor, and it's even bigger when you have someone else's life in your hands.",,0.84125537,0.4706344
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they feel about it? I don't mean to sound like a tool, but I'm usually asked about training. People seem fascinated by the idea of climbing through life's little boxes, as if that's something new and interesting. But for me the challenge has always been in finding those boxes. The memorization and rehearsal have always been necessary evils, an annoying part of the process needed to get me from Point A to Point B as efficiently as possible.",,0.6319945,0.5971941
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" Let's start with the former.",,0.8238638,0.3401393
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years. And then eventually, as you do with any hobby, you kind of outgrow it. You know, your love sort of wanes a little bit. And so now at almost 34 years old, I'm on the cusp of rekindling my love for climbing again.",,0.5069063,0.23359832
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked.,,0.22021735,0.048222497
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack.",,0.5976484,0.21772085
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing it was kind of like a coming out process for me and my views on society and stuff like that. Because before i started writing about climbing, nobody knew anything about me except my family and friends probably. But once I got into this space where people were reading my work and critiquing it publicly, then suddenly there was an audience for what I had to say which made me feel very vulnerable at first but also excited.",,0.5129957,0.5641148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I would do if I had the opportunity that most people would find too scary. But then again, maybe not!",,0.535811,0.61756027
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a priority, but it's something that has always interested me: What comes next? How do you define success? For me, climbing has always been about the journey as much as the destination. The actual achievement doesn't really matter--the challenge itself is what drives me.",,0.6897708,0.5944236
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Do I try to feel fear when it doesn’t serve a purpose? Or do I just let go and enjoy the ride?,,0.93612486,0.568197
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans are too afraid to admit it. But I will say this: If you're in the middle of a wall, and you take a small step to the right, then another small step to the right, and another small step to the right... eventually you'll get over the wall.",,0.6247557,0.24136886
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to see what else is out there.",,0.46716693,0.31726938
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be nice if we could all just take a deep breath and relax.,,0.7183931,0.30832306
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think.",,0.16148534,0.072078824
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think. I like to drink socially. You know, have a beer with friends and stuff. But yeah, I don't really like to get drunk.",,0.64022744,0.5861011
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't like to be afraid, but i'm glad that i'm capable of feeling it. If it means that i've got to feel some pain in order to do something really meaningful then so be it.",,0.7179312,0.6275872
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person then that's kind of obvious, but if you're not then no matter how much success you have it doesn't seem to make you any more self-confident.",,0.39264464,0.2046291
