But now she's here with me on this journey to Alaska--the first time we've ever met face-to-face--and it feels different somehow.""",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French, I think it was French.,1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I was probably three or four years old. My parents took me to the Red Rocks of Las Vegas, which is this natural amphitheater of red sandstone cliffs that's part of the Valley, and I just started climbing. I don't remember it, but I think it had something to do with my dad taking me to see a magic show or something like that and then taking me to this playground at Red Rocks and just leaving me there. But yeah, from like three years old on up, I was climbing all the time--in our backyard in Dallas or in our van on road trips.",0.0,,

9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of it. The sheer amount of climbing. The fact that there are no ropes or safety gear to speak of, just a thirty-five-foot rope and a single set of cams, nuts, and carabiners.",0.0,,

13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker, I don't know. I think they just liked the idea of a kid climbing a big wall.,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same thing that keeps me up at night. I want to be the best. I want to do things that other people don't even think are possible. It's like, ""Why not?"" That's what keeps me going, and it's what drove me through all those long nights in Yosemite when I was trying to free solo El Capitan.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Nose on El Cap, the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome, Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park, the Torre Traverse in Patagonia, Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre in Patagonia. I think those are my seven most memorable climbs.",,0.5262954,0.38047284
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," But I'm a good climber, and I've never had a serious injury.",,0.35261065,0.4565028
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario, but I don't dwell on it. I think about it in terms of probabilities. The probability of dying on a big wall is pretty low, but the probability of dying in a car accident is much higher. The same goes for falling off a cliff or being eaten by a shark. You just have to accept that those things are more likely to happen than getting killed by an animal or being in an accident while climbing.",,0.826463,0.3826419
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I mean, I have a good relationship with my family. And I have a good relationship with my friends. So if anything happened, you know, they'd be pretty bummed out but they'd get over it and move on with their lives. But you know there's no one that's going to miss me or care that much if i died or not so it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things whether i live or die right?",,0.38912097,0.4287455
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's because I've always been a bit of a perfectionist. I'm the kid who gets all A's in school, who does all my homework, and then is like, ""I can't believe I got a B on that test."" It doesn't matter if it's an A+ or an F--if you do your best and you don't give up, you will get the result that is your best.",,0.61775887,0.39510065
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", The answer is that I don't. I just do them.,,0.33539382,0.1260694
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I think that's a myth. I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration. I mean, maybe some of them do, but most of my climbs don't prepare me for free soloing at all.",,0.5504289,0.5502192
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I don't know. I think that, for me, the most important thing is that I'm able to connect with other people. The more people you can connect with and the more diverse your experience is, the better you're going to be as a climber.",,0.54091537,0.5001374
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities.", I think the same principles apply.,,0.58584803,0.046539478
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I mean, I don't know. It was--it was pretty amazing.",,0.5613296,0.32513905
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.", I just climb harder. I don't let it get in my way.,,0.6928316,0.3057137
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", How do other climbers train? What's the best way to prepare for a big wall project?,,0.9816303,0.579728
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's two things. One is that I'm willing to take big risks. I'm willing to push myself beyond what I thought was possible, and that requires a certain amount of confidence. The other thing is that, if you're going to push yourself beyond what you thought was possible, then you need a very clear idea of what's possible and how best to get there.",,0.6357697,0.57273036
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was just sort of trying to do the right thing. I mean, you know, I've had this idea for a long time that you should be able to climb on any of the world's mountains without paying any fees or anything like that. And so, when I was in college and then after college and traveling around the world climbing all these amazing mountains like in Patagonia or on Kilimanjaro or whatever but then when you get off these places they're all locked up with ropes and locks and fees.",,0.4120731,0.32175016
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know better than to try to solo a route. I know better than to go off-piste. But Sanni doesn’t have those same experiences, and she’s so young. She doesn’t have the life experience that I do, and she doesn’t have the fearlessness that I do. She has none of it! So why can't we just take fewer risks? Why can't we just be safer?",,0.72415805,0.44010317
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I guess the thing that scares me the most is that I'm going to get in a climbing accident and die.",,0.7284881,0.24749717
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's a fair assessment. For me, it's not life or death. It's just life and then some other stuff.",,0.4857572,0.5559835
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," In warrior culture, there's a code of honor. It's something like if you see your friend drowning, you're supposed to try to save him. If you're in a fight and your friend is fighting another man and he's about to get beaten up, it would be dishonorable for you not to try and help him. In free soloing it's the same thing--if I see someone else in trouble I'm supposed to jump in and help them out.",,0.76632166,0.29236975
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's both. I think that I'm just more comfortable with fear than most other people are.,,0.611681,0.74297017
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.", I think so. I think that I can use the same sort of determination and focus to figure out what the next step is.,,0.4998555,0.39205855
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," Or do I just shut off my brain and go for it? I think it’s important to remember that all the time. But you know, when you get to the top, and you’re standing on top of El Cap, or wherever it is that day, then yeah. You can feel like a god.",,0.51730275,0.41121176
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I wouldn’t say that. I would say that most humans are pretty risk-averse. Most humans aren’t doing anything interesting or meaningful with their lives. Most humans are just going through the motions of life, just trying to get by and not die.",,0.64268935,0.39894867
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.36698535,0.05835674
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that the way that we live now is not sustainable. I think it's going to get harder and harder to live in the way that we live now.",,0.63799226,0.35607976
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean I think it’s always been pretty close. I mean, you know, it’s like your best friend.",,0.4712916,0.14999337
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me.", I've been told that I don't drink enough.,,0.8122048,0.5889854
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
", I think the best way to deal with fear is to not let it affect your performance. You can't let it get in the way of a good climb.,,0.63117146,0.6072321
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think you have to have a certain amount of natural ability. But I think the biggest factor is just being in the right place at the right time. I was lucky enough to grow up in a place where climbing was really big, so there were always good crags nearby and good competitions going on. I grew up watching Tommy Caldwell destroy rocks, so that definitely had an impact on my psyche and made me want to try new things myself.",,0.7375752,0.3989536
