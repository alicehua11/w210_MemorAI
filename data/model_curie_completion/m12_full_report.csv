0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town in the foothills of the Sierras called Oakhurst. It's about an hour and a half from Yosemite Valley, but it feels like another world. I lived on a dead-end street lined with big old trees--oak, pine, fir--that were so thick you couldn't see through them to the other side. There was no traffic noise at all because we were up in the mountains; instead there was just bird song and squirrels chittering away as they foraged for food among our gardens and garbage cans.",0.0,,

4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know. I think she's a friend of mine, but I'm not sure. She lives in the Bay Area and we've hung out a few times, but it's always been kind of weird because we're both straight edge and into climbing.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think she spoke French to me. I don't know, maybe it was Spanish. But yeah, so my mom's from France and then we lived in Spain for a while and then we moved to the US when I was like three or something like that.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My dad took me to the Red Rocks area near Las Vegas, and we started hiking around the boulders there. He'd always been into climbing himself--he's a big fan of Patagonia and Yosemite--and he just thought it would be fun for us to explore some of those classic areas together.",0.0,,

8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight, I think it was either Tommy Caldwell's or Alex Honnold's.,0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall, which rises nearly 4,000 feet from base to summit. The fact that it's a big wall in an off-the-beaten-path location--not like Yosemite or Patagonia. And the fact that you have to free solo every pitch (aside from one 5.10 aid route).",1.0,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose. It's the hardest big wall free climb in the world, and it's on El Cap. I'd been dreaming of doing it for years, but I was always scared to try because there are so many pitches that are really hard and scary--pitch after pitch of 5.12 or harder with poor protection where you have to place gear yourself or clip fixed gear into anchors you can't see ahead--and then a long walk off between each one. The crux is at about 7 p . m . , when the whole face gets dark and scary, but if you do everything right your rope won't drag on any of those pitches because there aren't any holds in them!",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was the High Sierra. We did a lot of hiking in Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, but we also went to places like Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Lakes, which are much more accessible from Los Angeles.",0.0,,

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, I think the most memorable is definitely Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park. It’s a route that goes up this huge cliff on the east side of Zion. And it was my first big solo climb, and it was also one of my hardest climbs ever--I mean really hard for me at that time because I had never climbed anything harder than 5.12a before then--and so to do something like Moonlight Buttress which is rated 5.12d or whatever, but actually go up there and climb it as a solo climber with no rope or any kind of gear whatsoever except just some chalk bag and shoes...it's pretty crazy!",,0.41165024,0.56069696
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I understand that I'm free soloing. But I don't think it's fair to say that what I do is dangerous or irresponsible. It's true, there are no ropes and no gear to protect me, but the rock is very smooth and solid here in Yosemite. And since there are so few people who climb like this, nobody has a clue what they're doing!",,0.6423955,0.64727354
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about it less. I've learned to accept that fear is a part of climbing, and I just have to learn how to manage it better.",,0.5392165,0.75368834
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later.", I don't know. I've never really thought about it that much.,,0.54711795,0.19973682
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been pretty driven, and I'm not afraid to work hard at something if I really want to do it. And then there's the fact that my dad was a professional rock climber--he was an elite speed climber in his day, which is like bouldering but with no rope or gear. He taught me how to climb when I was little, and he pushed me very hard from an early age. So even though he died when I was fifteen, those lessons stuck with me throughout my life--how important preparation is for any big adventure you're about to embark on; how crucial it is that you feel totally comfortable doing what you're about to do; how much better your performance will be if your mind isn't clouded by doubt or fear or self-doubt . . .",,0.5117327,0.5853496
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that's a really important question. I mean, it's not like you can just look at the risks and say, ""Okay, this one is worth taking."" You know what I mean? It's more like how do you decide which risks are most valuable to take? And so for me personally there have been times when certain things felt less risky than others. Like climbing El Cap in winter was much riskier than free soloing Moonlight Buttress because if something goes wrong on El Cap then it could kill me whereas with Moonlight Buttress if something goes wrong then only my ego gets hurt.",,0.3768002,0.55750847
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe.",,0.531382,0.108186185
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, obviously when you're free soloing, there's no one else around to help you out. So that part is kind of lonely and scary and intense. But then on the other hand, when you're with somebody else doing it together--especially if they have a rope or harness--it makes things so much safer because they can catch you if anything goes wrong or get in your way if something interesting happens above them.",,0.6676933,0.5358952
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think that the two are quite different. Climbing is a very selfish pursuit, whereas giving back to society can be much more altruistic. I mean, obviously there's no way you're going to solve all of humanity's problems in your lifetime by climbing--or even by doing good deeds!",,0.67809546,0.5154704
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was only thirteen. I'd been climbing for a couple of years, but it was my first time on El Cap. It's such a big wall that you can't really appreciate the scale until you're actually there--until it's real and not just some idea in your head.",,0.64993334,0.55975974
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.","
The best way to climb with someone less experienced or talented is to make sure that you're both climbing at the same level. If your partner isn't as strong, then don't try hard pitches that you wouldn't be able to do on your own. On the other hand, if they are a lot weaker than you and can only manage 5.7 or so, then it's probably not worth trying harder climbs because they'll just get scared and slow down anyway (and also because it's generally more fun for both of you if there's some challenge involved). The key is finding a good balance between pushing them but still keeping them safe--it takes communication and experience to find this sweet spot!",,0.48033565,0.49579948
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I think it's pretty weird, actually. But then again, maybe not so much compared to other sports you can do without training at all. ",,0.26556227,0.35519856
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's the combination of preparation and luck. I've always been a planner, so when I'm climbing something new, my first step is to make a detailed plan. Then comes the hard part--executing that plan in real life!",,0.66437125,0.58812803
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of my friend, Hans Florine. He's a great climber and has done some amazing free soloing.",,0.72774684,0.25253114
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know that she’s not in any danger. But still, it seems like a waste to climb so hard and then just chill on the ground.",,0.70181227,0.282086
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the thing that scares me most is death. I mean, it's not like I'm afraid to die or anything. But you know, when you're climbing and something goes wrong and then there's no one around to help you out of a bad situation? That would be pretty scary.",,0.48808113,0.2955754
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true. But for me, it's not about life and death. It's just about the experience of climbing these big walls and pushing myself to my limits in a way that I can't do anywhere else in my life.",,0.6696278,0.54814535
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Warrior culture is a very specific type of warrior society that exists in the Pacific Islands. It's an extremely violent society, and it's based on this idea of ""face."" In other words, if you're going to fight somebody, you have to look him straight in the eye while you're fighting him. That way he knows who he's fighting and that it means something.",,0.6096668,0.40691298
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, you know, I think that fear is an important motivator for many things in life. But at the same time there are some things that you just have to do because they're interesting or challenging or fun and if you were afraid then maybe somebody else could do them but not as well as someone who's having fun doing it.",,0.59077716,0.7223143
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I don’t know if it will work out the same way as climbing, but you know, maybe something else will come along that is just as interesting and challenging.",,0.6802081,0.5982754
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it go and enjoy the ride?,,0.8598163,0.39078996
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that’s true.

40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness.

Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
