0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little house in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri. I was the youngest of three kids, and my two older brothers were pretty much as competitive as it gets between brothers--competitive in everything from sports to video games to girls. They were always pushing and pulling me: ""You should do this,"" ""You should do that."" It was a constant back-and-forth throughout my childhood.",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I mean, I know he's my dad. But I don't know him. He's just this guy who had a kid with his girlfriend and then got sent to prison and now he doesn't want anything to do with me.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," What's my sign? How tall am I?"" The whole thing.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick, What's my dad like? What's my childhood like? What are my hobbies? I don't know. I don't talk about myself.,0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know. I don't think she knows that I'm here. She's like, ""Oh, my sister is like obsessed with you."" Like whatever.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I don't know. I think she was like, ""I don't know, like whatever."" I was like, ""What?""",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was like four or something. I mean, maybe younger. But definitely by the time I was in elementary school, which is when my parents started taking me to the rock parks around Los Angeles.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, my dad got a permanent job at the University of Oregon. He was an assistant professor of English there. And then he was also the head coach for their men's gymnastics team, which is kind of a big deal because it's like the biggest sport at that university.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was the one I knew best. And Dean Potter. Peter Croft. But also people like Jim Erickson and Mike Gauthier and Jim Erickson's dad, the guy named after the song by Jimmy Stewart in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence."" He was a great climber in his day--Jim Erickson Senior--and he passed on his love of climbing to all of his seven kids.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," For starters, there are the sheer scale of the wall itself. The route is spread over more than 2,000 feet of vertical granite. That's about a third of a mile -- about as far as you can walk without climbing! And that's not even counting the approach or descent. The sheer magnitude of the wall is what makes El Cap feel so big, even though it's only twice as high as Free Rider (a nearby route on Half Dome).",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I'll have a coffee, a banana, and some protein powder. I'll have a smoothie for lunch. For dinner I might make myself chicken and vegetables with rice or quinoa. Or maybe steak and vegetables with rice or quinoa.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose on El Cap. It's the most iconic big wall in the world, and it's also one of my favorite walls to climb. I'd been dreaming about it for years, but I knew that if I was going to do it, now was the time--in large part because of all the media attention that had been focused on Yosemite in 2011 and 2012. In 2011 Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson had climbed a new variation up a route called The Noseless Superfreak Route (a reference to an episode of South Park), which got a lot of press because they were only the second team ever to climb The Nose free (no rope) in one day. That same year Mark Synnott soloed Moonlight Buttress--the first free ascent ever of what is widely regarded as America's hardest single-day climbing route at 5.12d/12d or harder--and then soloed Half Dome as well (5+ hours). In 2012 Mark Synnott freed El Cap again with Tommy Caldwell, this time doing so without rope or gear other than their harnesses and shoes, which is even more impressive than their Moonlight Buttress ascent since they did all this big-wall climbing without any protection other than their harnesses!",1.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I'd say Yosemite. We did a bunch of different hikes in Yosemite over the years. I think we did the John Muir Trail, which is a little bit longer, more difficult variation of the Pacific Crest Trail that goes all the way from Mexico to Canada.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," I think it was in 2008, when I was in Alaska. I had just soloed the Nose on El Cap, and that got some attention. But then, a few months later--I think it was in January 2009--I free soloed Half Dome in a single day. That got even more attention than the El Cap feat put together!",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same things that drive other people crazy--the need to constantly improve, to outdo myself. And I think that the best climbers have a similar hunger for adventure. They want to push their limits and see what they're capable of doing.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Nose on El Cap, Moonlight Buttress in Zion, the Torre Traverse in Patagonia, the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome in Yosemite with Dean Potter and Mark Synnott. And then two free solo climbs. One was a big wall in China called the Great Roof. And then another wall called Astroman near Beijing that was a really long single pitch of about 800 feet with no gear at all.""",,0.38864353,0.5335055
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I just trust my own abilities.,,0.73247546,0.20401657
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," Well, I mean, you know, it's funny because I think a lot of people who read about my climbing exploits are like you're so crazy and they're like why do that? And the thing is is that fear is actually a good thing. You know when your body's telling you to stop and smell the roses.",,0.38730922,0.54727656
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't really think about it. I mean, you know, if it happens then happens.",,0.35925922,0.3545655
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it will be interesting for people to hear.,,0.6872039,0.05026354
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," It's funny, because I don't think I've really developed that focus. It's just sort of there. When I was a kid, climbing trees and hiking in the backcountry and all that stuff seemed like a lot of fun. But then when you get older, you start to realize that there are actual risks involved with tree climbing and hiking off cliffs--real risks like getting hurt or even dying. And so you start to think about it more carefully, which is what happened to me as I got older and started thinking about things like getting into fights or breaking up with girlfriends or whatever else life might bring my way.",,0.62012154,0.4784171
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," For me, climbing is all about pushing the limits of my abilities. The risks I take are a direct result of my confidence in executing them.",,0.73571527,0.43684393
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to.", I don't think so. Climbing is a team sport. I think you need to have a team of people who are going to help you prepare for the big free solo.,,0.62001836,0.60495734
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it all depends on the project. I mean, I think that soloing is a more pure form of expression. But, you know, with the right team behind you and everything set up properly and all that kind of stuff it doesn't really matter if you're soloing or climbing with a rope because at the end of the day it's still just about expressing yourself in as pure an way as possible.",,0.5043696,0.6237909
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I mean, I think that they're both about using your platform to help others. I think that they're both about using your privilege for good. And you know, I mean, it's funny because a lot of people ask me like how do you feel about the fact that like some people might be like why are you risking your life for other people when so many other poor or vulnerable or whatever who need help don't have the platform to do something back as well?",,0.38404864,0.26789653
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh, my God. This is so rad."" It's like the first time you have sex and it's with the person you're going to marry. It's just such a mind-blowing experience that it never really sinks in.",,0.749668,0.2665192
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," For the most part, you don't. It's not like one person is going to make the other better, even if they're both climbing well. If you're climbing well yourself, then it's not really fair to expect someone else to improve just because they're with you--the best thing is for everyone just to enjoy themselves and have fun.",,0.50664234,0.54571265
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I think it's pretty weird. I mean, I've never told anyone this before, but when I was about fourteen or fifteen, my dad took me to see a climbing wall in an indoor gym. He was trying to get me into it for my own amusement. But as soon as we got there, all I wanted to do was leave and go home! The only thing that kept me from walking out the door was the fear that if he asked why, then . . . what would have happened if he didn't ask?",,0.6532184,0.37726223
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," Well, I think that the biggest breakthroughs in climbing come from learning how to deal with fear. I mean, you know, a lot of people think that if they were just stronger or more talented or whatever then they'd be able to climb more things. But for me it's always been about learning how to deal with fear and control my anxiety and all that sort of stuff.",,0.55455637,0.57155216
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think that there's a lot of good work that needs to be done in the world, but I also think that there's a lot of good work being done in the world. And I don't want to get involved with it because it would take away from my focus and my energy. So if somebody wants to do something and they need help, then I'm happy for them if they call me up and ask me for help.",,0.73273414,0.45073062
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could climb more carefully. I could wear a helmet. I could wear a harness or at least use a rope, you know? But then the whole point of climbing is to push yourself as far as you can go. And that means taking some risks. If Sanni wants me to be safer, then she can put a rope or harness or something between us and keep me safe while she climbs without any risk at all.""",,0.51360923,0.39406806
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I think that when you're free soloing that you're like, ""I don't want to be there,"" like I don't want to be in the gym.",,0.39833853,0.26167402
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better.", What if I mess up?,,0.8033898,0.25953054
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.,,,0.9012281,-0.10481568
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I don't know. I think it's probably a little of both.,,0.4967156,0.16017629
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I don't know. I think that climbing has been a big part of my life for so long, and will continue to be, but I also feel like it's important for me to have other things in my life. It's important for me to have a family and friends and all of that stuff. It's not just about climbing all the time.",,0.5523271,0.5567175
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it go and have fun?,,0.86027926,0.37410158
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Hell, no. But I think we can do better. I think we can all do better.",,0.41791004,0.31740913
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean, I think that's fair to say.",,0.31122562,0.15905899
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. And I think that we live in a world where there are so many incredible opportunities for personal growth and adventure and, you know, just you know doing things that are a little bit outside of your comfort zone. And so I do think it would be good for all of us to be more open to those opportunities.",,0.56771535,0.33485746
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
",,,0.9012281,-0.015160259
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think that it comes from a combination of genetics and practice. I think that I have a certain genetic makeup, which means that I'm pretty good at climbing things. But then, over the years, through lots of hard work and training, which has included lots of climbing outside as well as training indoors on the wall--I've climbed so much outside in the last few years--I've kind of built up this skill set where now it's almost effortless for me to do what I call 'epic climbs'--climbs with ratings above 5.12a or 7a or whatever they are at the time.",,0.54310524,0.44907367
