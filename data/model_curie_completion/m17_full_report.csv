0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town called St. George, Utah. It's in the desert part of southern Utah, about an hour and a half from Las Vegas by car. I was born there on January 19, 1985--the day after my parents' twentieth wedding anniversary.",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, he's not around anymore. But it doesn't matter to me if my dad is a mailman or the president of the United States. He was there for me when I needed him, and that's all that matters.""",0.0,,

""I mean, it sounds like you've had an amazing life so far.""",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know. I think she's my sister, but maybe not. Maybe it's just a metaphor for the way we're connected to each other in life and death.""",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think she spoke French to me. I don't know, maybe it was English.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was like three or something. My dad took me to the Red Rocks park in Las Vegas, and we started climbing on some of the sandstone cliffs there.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a permanent job at the University of Chicago, which is where I went to school.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I think it was Tommy Caldwell's book, which I read when I was like fifteen. It blew my mind.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall, which is 1,500 feet higher than Mount Everest. The fact that it's a big wall with no real trail--only one route has ever been completed. And then there are all those scary stories about falling off and dying on El Cap.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't have a usual breakfast. I mean, it's whatever I can get my hands on. You know, if there's bread in the house or something like that then that'll be what I eat for breakfast. If not then just whatever else is around at the time will do",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose on El Cap. It's the biggest free solo climb in the world, and it's a big challenge just to get up there. But once you're on top of it, that route is so well-protected by bolts that you can basically do any sequence of moves over and over again for as long as you want--as long as your rack holds up!",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was the High Sierra. We did a lot of hiking in Yosemite and other places like that, but I also remember doing some pretty epic hikes on the east side of the range, in New Hampshire and Vermont.",0.0,,

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same thing that keeps anybody motivated. I mean, you know, like a challenge or something to overcome. You know, like climbing this wall is hard and then I have to do it in under two hours which is even harder so there's always some sort of mental component as well.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is a free solo of Half Dome in Yosemite. The second is El Capitan--the big wall on the east side of Yosemite. Then there's Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park, which I did with my friend Tommy Caldwell. We called it ""The World's Most Dangerous Route."" It was rated 5.12d at the time but we thought it was harder than that because you have to lieback up some really steep sections and then link them together with long traverses across tiny ledges where your feet barely clear space between two cracks or something like that.",,0.5792739,0.52934116
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I understand that I'm free soloing. But, you know, it's not like I'm doing something crazy or dangerous.",,0.65474343,0.53937924
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario. I know that if I get into trouble, there's a good chance that nobody will find me for days or even weeks. So when my mind starts to wander and worry sets in, I just remind myself of how long it would take to rescue me--and then realize that worrying won't change anything.",,0.7389108,0.5858204
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I could handle the grief of losing my dad, or dealing with all the media attention that would come with dying on El Cap. But then again, maybe climbing is just what I need to confront these fears and deal with them head-on.",,0.7285825,0.4663701
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been pretty competitive, and when you're young, that can drive you to push yourself in ways that are healthy for your development as an athlete. But then there's the other side of me--the one who likes to party too much!",,0.7009584,0.39745763
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that's a really good question. And it's one that I've thought about for years and years and years.",,0.66949177,0.1443189
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say because I haven't done any yet.",,0.40852192,0.11156207
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it depends on the project. I like to work with other people, but there are certain projects where you have to go solo because they're so dangerous that no one else would even consider trying them.",,0.71963453,0.5517626
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think it's pretty similar. I mean, obviously the stakes are a lot higher in climbing than they are in philanthropy. But you know, for me personally, I feel like both of them have been very fulfilling and rewarding experiences that help make life better for other people.",,0.6890695,0.500654
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I don't know. I was just a kid, you know? It's like the first time you go to Disneyland or something. You're like, ""This is so cool!"" But then after that it's no big deal.",,0.5180895,0.25705647
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.","
The best way to climb with someone less experienced or talented is to make sure that you're both climbing well. If one of you is having a bad day, the other should be able to keep things in check. You can also help each other by giving feedback on your technique and encouraging each other when it's needed. For example, if I'm leading and my partner isn't quite clipping the chains properly, I might say something like ""I'd really prefer not to clip this last bolt from below."" Or if he's struggling on a crux move but doesn't want me to belay him because he thinks he can do it himself, I'll tell him ""You don't have enough experience yet for that sequence.""",,0.6001911,0.5740608
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I think it's pretty extreme, but maybe that's just me.",,0.6614388,0.3596489
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. One is that I've always been pretty lucky with my preparation, so when the time came to execute, I was ready. But another part of it has to do with being open-minded about what works and doesn't work in climbing--what techniques are worth trying and which ones aren't.",,0.7306263,0.65479374
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of my friend, Hans Fugal. He is a climber from Switzerland who has devoted his life to building schools in Africa for kids that have no access to education.",,0.6681527,0.33722353
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I can always take fewer risks. It’s just that sometimes the only way to get what you want is to go for it all at once.",,0.6543255,0.43413574
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the thing that scares me most is death. I mean, it's not like I'm afraid of dying or anything. But if you're climbing alone in a remote place and something happens to you--like, for example, if there was an accident on El Capitan right now and somebody died up there--I don't know what would happen to my soul after that.",,0.7503071,0.26693752
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.,,,0.9012281,-0.10481568
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Warrior culture is a very specific type of warrior society. It's like the ancient Greek or Roman warrior societies, where you have this whole class of warriors who are basically trained from childhood to be fearless and do crazy things for glory. They're sort of like gladiators in that they fight other people for sport, but it's not really about winning--it's more about showing off your skill and courage.",,0.6237498,0.46664876
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, you know, there are people who have no fear and then there are people like me who do things that most other people would be afraid to do.",,0.629755,0.6598797
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, you know, climbing is all about preparation and anticipation and risk management. And those are the same things that make for a good life in general--pushing yourself to do what you're not sure you can do but knowing that if you prepare properly then it will be easier than ever before.",,0.5294421,0.6263026
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I don’t know. I think that the more you do it, the less fragile your life feels.",,0.42335486,0.4812841
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that most people do. I think that most people are afraid to take risks, and they live within the median.",,0.5554652,0.36148
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all be a little bit more irrational.",,0.6389711,0.36494774
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean, I think it's pretty close to what you would expect from somebody who grew up in the woods and then spent his life exploring mountains.",,0.8108936,0.42507535
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I've never been a big drinker.",,0.79413,0.62199986
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural human emotion, and it's important to acknowledge its presence. But I don't let it stop me from doing what I want to do.",,0.78707117,0.5870395
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things. I mean, obviously you have to be good at what you do and then once you get better than average, that helps too. But for me the most important thing is just having fun with it all--having fun with climbing itself, but also having fun with training and preparation and competition.",,0.5159708,0.48566294
