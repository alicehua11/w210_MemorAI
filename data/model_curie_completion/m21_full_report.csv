0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a van. My dad had this old Dodge van, and we lived in it for years while he worked on his books. It was pretty cool--I mean, I slept in a bed that wasn't too bad! But then when I was about ten or so, my parents got a real house with an indoor bathroom and everything. So now we just stay at hotels.""",0.0,,

7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a permanent job at the University of Colorado, in Boulder. He was sort of like an assistant professor or something.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I think it was Tommy Caldwell's. I mean, he's just a hero of mine. He has this whole history of crazy free solos that push the limits of climbing and danger and all that kind of stuff.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. It's 3,000 feet (900 meters) high, and it takes years to climb in the traditional style. The first time I climbed El Cap--in 2010--I spent a total of 19 days on the wall. But that was with an experienced team led by Tommy Caldwell, who took me under his personal wing for my two weeks on the wall.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't have a usual breakfast. I mean, it's whatever is around. If there's eggs or something in the kitchen, then I'll eat those. But normally just like trail mix and bars and stuff like that.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Triple Crown of Climbing--the three great routes on the highest peaks in the world. The Nose on El Cap, Moonlight Buttress, and Freerider at Red Rocks. I'd been dreaming about climbing them all since I was a kid. But then life got in the way, and it took me until my late thirties to finally do them all!",1.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I mean, I think it's pretty clear that the Seven Summits was always going to be Mount Everest for him. He'd been after me for years to go climb with him on a big wall. And so finally in 2010, he got his chance and passed away before he could really get into it. But I went back in 2015 and did both towers of El Chalten together with my friend Tommy Caldwell from the United States who's also an amazing climber and is now sponsored by The North Face which makes sense because they're like this perfect combination of strength and style",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," I don't know if they were convinced. I think it's just that the right people saw my film and thought, ""This guy seems like a good fit for our brand.""",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same thing that keeps anybody motivated. I mean, you know, just a desire to do better and improve yourself and learn new things.

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Nose on El Cap, the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome in Yosemite, Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park (the first free ascent), Astroman at Prince of Darkness near Las Vegas, the Great Roof on Black Velvet Wall at Smith Rock and finally a speed solo up the Rostrum route up El Cap.",,0.3787342,0.43734854
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I'm just trusting my own body to hold up.,,0.7641134,0.28657794
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about the worst-case scenario. I imagine falling and breaking my leg or getting impaled on a cliff. But then I remind myself that those things don't happen to climbers who play it safe, which is why so many people die trying--they're not playing it safe.",,0.485403,0.39736474
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I could handle that, but then again, maybe that's what life is all about. Maybe the only way to truly experience life is to face your fears and accept the possibility of losing everything you love.",,0.78072184,0.41803646
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of factors. I'm lucky enough to have parents who are both professional athletes, so they've always driven us to work hard and be disciplined in the pursuit of excellence. They also took me on my first climbing trip when I was six years old, which is pretty young by today's standards. But more than that, they modeled for me what it means to focus completely on something and give everything you have for long periods of time--a lesson that has stayed with me my whole life.",,0.6786255,0.43285638
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that the key to being a good climber is knowing which risks to take and when. I mean, you can't just go off soloing every random overhanging crack or slab system that appeals to you. You have got to know what your own limits are--and stay within them.",,0.6079574,0.52111626
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe.",,0.531382,0.108186185
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it depends on the kind of climbing. I've always thought that El Cap is a team sport, because there are so many different aspects to it--the logistics of getting up the wall, dealing with storms and darkness and all kinds of things. It's like an athletic event as well as a physical challenge. And then you have all these other climbers who help out by belaying or portaging your gear or whatever they can do to make your climb easier for you. So in some ways El Cap is more like a relay than soloing would be, though obviously nobody else gets credit for helping me along!",,0.52573466,0.57992613
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think that the two are pretty similar. I mean, obviously they're very different sports and you know, but in some ways it's kind of cool to be able to apply your climbing skills towards something that is actually beneficial for society.",,0.43786007,0.45512465
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh my God! This is the best thing in life!"" I mean, it's pretty epic when you're standing on the summit of El Cap and you've just climbed a big wall.",,0.78161913,0.64844686
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't think so. I've always been a bit of an obsessive, but in the past it was more about video games or girls or whatever else captured my attention. Climbing did that for me, and still does. But now there's no other sport I'd rather train for than climbing.""",,0.5776863,0.5288672
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's the same thing that led to my breakthrough in free soloing. I just keep pushing myself, trying new things. ",,0.45651406,0.5514549
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of others. The foundation is really about supporting other climbers in their projects, whether that means funding a film project or just helping out with travel costs for somebody who wants to go somewhere and climb something cool.",,0.7529688,0.42853713
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know it's not the same thing as climbing a mountain or jumping off a cliff. But still--"" ""But you're doing something that scares you,"" Sanni interrupted. ""That makes you feel alive.""",,0.5183406,0.52881646
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I don't know.",,0.5248424,0.147538
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I don't know. I mean, you just never know what's going to happen and how it's all going to play out.",,0.55727947,0.17476755
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's true. But for me, it's not life or death. It's just another day on the rock.",,0.60486364,0.5498928
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's probably a little of both.,,0.6141964,0.109193504
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, it would be nice to have a steady job and all that stuff, but I don’t know if that's really what my true calling is.",,0.6113336,0.34347582
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think about it all the time.",,0.75546765,0.13910484
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that most humans would admit to that. But I also think, and this is the part of my life where I try to live outside the median, you know it's like trying to push myself out of my comfort zone as much as possible. And so for me personally, yeah there are times when i'm like ""This is comfortable"" or ""This feels safe."" You know but then other times when i'm just like ""I don't even care anymore.""",,0.32792515,0.6216415
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all take more risks.",,0.6346221,0.39545432
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean, I think it's pretty close personally.",,0.4721456,0.08654428
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I've never been a big drinker, I guess.",,0.41505703,0.6168125
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. It's what makes us human, it motivates us to achieve our goals and it keeps us safe.",,0.61639166,0.5022751
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of genetics and environment. I was born with the ability to do certain things, but I had to learn how to do them. My dad taught me how to play tennis when I was five or six years old--he just sort of showed up at our house one day and started hitting balls with us. He still plays competitively in his seventies, which is pretty amazing for someone who never played professionally.",,0.6341584,0.26418698
