6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about 5 or 6. I definitely remember my dad taking me to the climbing gym when I was very young. Maybe 2 or 3. But my first real memories of climbing are from before I went to elementary school, from around the time my dad started coaching me in sport climbs and things like that at our home in Sacramento, California.",0.0,,

8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Oh, I read all kinds of people. I mean, I read all kinds of books. But, um, you know, classic climbers are like the old school classics. And so you read all about like the greats from the 19th century and before. And so it's kind of like a weird mix between those classic stories and then also you know modern stories where people are still living them out today sort of thing.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," I mean, other than the sheer scale of the wall, which is pretty much unprecedented. I mean, there are tons of guys that have tried to free solo El Cap and failed. I think the main thing that scares most people off is sheer scale. You know, just the sheer magnitude of this wall.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I have a whole repertoire of breakfast foods. I'm a big fan of eggs and potatoes. You know, just hard-boiled eggs and hash browns. Or cereal with milk and fruit or something. You know, just simple breakfast foods.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," That's easy, it's a solo around the world. I've thought about it for years, I've prepared for it for years. In some ways, it's just a matter of sitting in a kayak or on a mountain bike and following the sun. In other ways, it's incredibly complicated and difficult. But that is what I'm here to do.""",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think the one that comes to mind is Devil's Bay on the South Coast of Newfoundland. It's this huge, windswept plateau that drops off really steeply on all sides. There's a very famous hiking trail there that follows a old mining road, and it was sort of this epic hike with our bikes because you're climbing this old-school mountain bike trail with these really big, sweeping turns.",0.0,,

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know, really. I think that at some point, you just kind of have to decide that it's all or nothing.

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, let's see. The first one is the first big free solo I ever did, which was a thousand feet up a big wall in Israel. It was kind of an epiphany, because I realized that I could do anything I set my mind to.",,0.5479338,0.59048843
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", So how do I get up the wall?,,0.47975874,0.38592994
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't know, man. I mean, I think that the most important thing is just to recognize that it's there and then to remind myself of the reasons why I want to do this and how it will benefit me in the long run. You know, like when you're driving on a highway for the first time or something like that, you're like oh my God this is so scary but then after a while you're like well this is pretty comfortable. You know what I mean?",,0.5212036,0.56447357
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later.", I don't really know.,,0.38483492,0.0864985
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, I think that the more you do something, the better you get at it. And so I think that free soloing has definitely helped me with my rock climbing in other ways.",,0.59683293,0.66790813
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a strong sense of purpose. You know, like to be driven by a desire to do something that's greater than the sum of its parts. You know, like to feel like your life has meaning beyond just surviving and having a good time.",,0.47654188,0.29175338
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I think that all of our pursuits in climbing help prepare you for free soloing. I mean, take the case of the Valley wall. That was all about balance and body position and things like that. So it does help to have a good grasp of balance and body position on rock or on ice or whatever before you go up and solo free. But beyond that, I think it's important to have a very wide range of interests so that you're constantly learning new things and growing as a person. And so when it comes time to soloing something, there's already plenty in your tool kit that you can draw from your experience with other climbs just to help you along the way.",,0.5297686,0.74662673
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think I prefer the personal challenge of an one-on-one competition. But I also think that when you have a really strong team, it can be inhibiting. When you go up on a big wall, do you feel the need to pull everybody else up with you? Or do you feel free to just go up there and climb?",,0.8678028,0.49863088
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Honnold: I think that the two things are pretty similar in that they both just represent a desire to improve the world in some way. I mean, when you're climbing, you're basically just trying to improve your own performance. When you're philanthropic, it's the same thing. You're just trying to better humanity in some way.",,0.69791526,0.3847633
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh, my God. That is the most amazing thing in the world.""",,0.8672036,0.2840081
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.", Do I feel competitive when I climb with other people?,,0.9989696,0.37927452
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", Is there a less-rigorous way of approaching a big free solo?,,0.8425741,0.2943877
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think that the best way to answer that is to tell the stories of my climbs. I've spent most of my life in the backcountry, and I've made a lot of progress there. But when I came to Yosemite, in 2008, things were pretty stagnant for me. I'd already climbed most of what was worth climbing in the Valley--the Regular Northwest Face on El Capitan and the Dihedral Wall on Half Dome being among my best routes ever. But now, for whatever reason--perhaps because it was too hot that year--I found myself stalled in my climbing career.",,0.62455285,0.4863225
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," It's a combination of altruism and selfishness. I'm definitely doing it for the right reasons, but I'm also doing it because I think it's fun.",,0.70722127,0.37958056
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," Because for me, the reward is so much greater when I share it with someone else.",,0.59097344,0.42122883
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I don't know, I mean, obviously there's a big difference. When you're climbing with bolts and harnesses and stuff like that you're still doing it in a controlled environment. You're still going to have a harness and a rope to catch you if you fall. Whereas when you're free soloing there's no margin for error. You either make it all the way to the top or not at all.",,0.64380896,0.2590171
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," Well, I guess the thing that scares me most is pain and suffering. I mean, there's a reason the old-timers called rock climbing ""healing through pain."" Because that's basically what it is.",,0.5960268,0.2321884
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That's a big part of what attracted me to free soloing in the first place. But I also think that climbing has taught me how to deal with fear. When I'm free soloing, I'm totally comfortable with fear, because it's just not there. It's a totally different experience than being afraid and not being able to do anything about it.",,0.8040372,0.4159212
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I mean, I think it's probably a little bit of both.",,0.6234733,0.11888679
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," There are certainly applications. I mean, I think that the kind of focus and determination that you need to put into climbing is the same kind of thing that you need to apply to your other goals in life. You know, like if you want to achieve a certain goal, like if I want to go and climb El Capitan, it takes a lot of determination and it takes a lot of focus. And so do all my other goals in life. You know what I mean? Like if i'm gonna go out and buy a house or something like that it takes all kinds of focus too so i'm pretty sure those two things aren't correlated!",,0.42610562,0.7754273
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Do I worry that my next step will be my last?,,0.9865506,0.30001944
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other.", Absolutely. But I also think that most humans would admit that they could live within the mean and still be happy.,,0.47819847,0.60074705
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean I think that you could argue that, you know, at some point every climber becomes a little bit addicted to climbing. But I think for me it was just about finding new challenges and new adventures.",,0.47841623,0.4629988
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be healthier for all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more and not be so risk-averse.,,0.64646184,0.44187167
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean you know I still value the natural world, I still feel a deep connection to it. But I think that my experience with nature has made me more of a human being, you know more empathetic and more compassionate and less selfish. You know, so when i'm in the backcountry or in nature for that matter anywhere really. I'm always struck by how much human impact we have on the Earth and how much we take from it without giving anything back.",,0.38486984,0.59084344
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I don't know, I guess I just have a hard time showing my emotions when it comes to alcohol.",,0.6214255,0.5645152
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think it's sort of a waste of energy. I think that if you're going to be afraid, you should be afraid on the actual climb, not beforehand or after.",,0.664556,0.72608316
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I mean, I think that, you know, obviously it's nice to be confident in the face of adversity but I also think that confidence is sort of an accumulative thing. You know, like if you're doing something over and over and over again and not really thinking about it you kind of get more and more confident. But if you're just standing on one plank for five minutes then suddenly thinking ""Oh my God this is scary"" then your confidence gets shaken a little bit.",,0.640907,0.34974122
