4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, My sister is the universe.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," English. Italian. She was kind of a linguist, so she could speak several languages and she would just switch back and forth between them as the situation demanded. I think my dad spoke French, but I'm not sure.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I started climbing when I was four or five. My parents took me to my first climbing gym when I was maybe six, and a year later, in 1992, we moved to Tucson so that my dad could take a job at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a job in a quarry. He was like a laborer or something. They were sort of like grunt jobs, but he got to live in El Paso, which was pretty cool for him.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, I read all kinds of books. But the ones that really stuck with me were the ones that combined adventure and a little bit of romance. The classic example is John Krakauer's ""Into the Wild.""",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," A lot of it has to do with the sheer scale of the wall. It's 3,200 feet of sheer granite, after all. But I think what scares people most is that they don't know what's on the other side of that wall. They don't know if there's a safe route or not. And then once they get up there, they're like ""Oh my God! There are so many moves! I'm gonna die!""",1.0,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was to climb the Nose in a single day. That's what I'd always thought about as the ultimate challenge, but I'd never seriously considered doing it. In 2010, though, after soloing and speed climbing various routes on El Cap and Half Dome--all with my then-roommate Brad Barlage--I felt ready for the big jump. And so on June 2, 2010, Brad and I set out to climb the Nose in a single day.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was the High Sierra. We did a lot of hiking in Yosemite and things like that. I remember my dad taking me to see the movie The Rainbow Warrior, which I think was in like 1987 or '86, and it's this epic thing about this climber who gets trapped in a storm on a cliff. It's sort of like an action-adventure movie with some climbing scenes in it, but what I remember most is just sitting through the whole thing with my dad because he loved that kind of stuff.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the challenge of improvement. I mean, I love climbing more than ever, and I still have this burning desire to improve. It's like an addiction, you know. You can't stop once you start.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, there's the first one, which is the Fitz Traverse in Patagonia. There's a second one that I did in Patagonia with a really strong alpinist named Sean Leary. He was an amazing partner and an amazing climber.",,0.5167037,0.34841442
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I just have to trust my own body weight and the holds I find.,,0.58060616,0.2624638
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't really know. I mean, I think that if you're truly afraid of something, then you will experience it as fear. If you don't experience it as fear then there's something wrong with your feelings about the danger or whatever.",,0.5598872,0.7278018
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I mean, you just sort of have to accept it. You know, you just have to be ready for it.",,0.5824766,0.37910146
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of commitment. I mean, I think that you know, like anything in life, you know, like if you really want to do something and then you make the commitment to do it and then work hard at it and sort of stay focused on what needs to be done. You can achieve great things.",,0.4888244,0.36963964
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a strong sense of purpose. I mean, if you're doing something because it's a cool experience or because it's lucrative or whatever, then you're probably not going to be very happy. If you have a strong sense of purpose and are choosing the risks that are right for your skillset and for your personality type then I think those things will sort themselves out over time.",,0.71760464,0.51846206
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, I think that all climbing does help prepare you for soloing, but it's hard to quantify how much.",,0.53249574,0.65838206
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's both. I think that when you're in the moment of doing it alone, you're not really thinking about the consequences of your actions. But when you're in a group, somebody has to be in charge. Somebody has to make decisions about tactics and strategy and how to deal with fear--and if that somebody isn't me, then I'm going to have a hard time leading.",,0.60331196,0.293117
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I mean, I think that any time you're doing something for the first time, you're sort of learning as you go. And so I think that with Honnold Foundation and any other type of nonprofit work that we do, there's always going to be room for improvement.",,0.5716869,0.23781279
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight, I think. I mean, it was obviously terrifying. But also really exciting, you know. It's funny because when you watch the video of me climbing El Cap back then, it doesn't really look that scary because I'm just sitting on this one hold for the whole climb. But when you're doing it for real there's like a ton of exposure and if your foot slips or anything happens your head is right next to this big drop so it's pretty scary and intimidating at the same time.",,0.58316994,0.50055665
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," For that matter, how do I even define ""talent""? I've never thought of myself as especially talented at climbing. But then, maybe that's why I've never won a major climbing competition.",,0.87371516,0.29324022
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I mean, I know that other climbers train in a different way. They learn moves or sequences on rock, then try to repeat them. The problem with that style is that it takes a long time to learn moves or sequences on rock, then you have to wait a long time before you can try them again. In contrast, by training the movements in the gym over and over again until they're dialed and ingrained in my memory (and there's no difference between training the movements on indoor boulders and outdoor walls), I can go straight from learning about holds and edges on one wall to trying those same holds and edges on another wall without having to think about it too much beforehand.",,0.6463756,0.50552654
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. First, I'm just lucky. I've had some really great mentors--people like Steph Davis and Mark Synnott and John Bachar and Erickson--who have taken me under their wings, taught me everything they know, given me opportunities they might not have had themselves.",,0.74208343,0.2602426
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I guess you could say that I've been trying to solve the problem of my own mortality for as long as I can remember. When you're a kid, death is always just a little bit out of reach. You don't really think about it that much--it's not like there's any good pizza restaurants in the afterlife. But as you get older, and especially if you have family members who have died young themselves, it starts to nag at the back of your mind. You wonder if maybe there's something about your own life story that will make death avoidable for others--if some part of what happened to me could help save some other lives down the line.",,0.58843184,0.35216826
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could be, like, a total pussy and only do routes that are totally free. But then I wouldn't have any challenges to solo.",,0.6223838,0.29496962
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I don’t know. I mean, obviously there are places that you go when you're free soloing that are different than when you're roped up with a bunch of other people.",,0.6524202,0.29938674
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," Well, I mean, it's just the unknown. I don't know if I'll feel alive tomorrow or if my life will be worth living. You know, there's a little bit of the unknown that scares me about everything.",,0.43098208,0.18851635
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's a fair assessment. But I also think that there's a certain element of choice involved. That if you look at the statistics on rock climbing fatalities, you know, it's like 90 percent of people who die in rock climbing accidents were doing something else at the time. It wasn't like they were going to climb and then suddenly it turned into an accident. Most people who die in accidents where they're doing something else are driving to the crag or are walking down the hill and they step off edge or whatever it is, 90 percent of those kinds of deaths are preventable with proper preparation and equipment and training so I think there is a element of choice involved on some level because most people would never choose to go out in an unsafe manner but if you're going out with friends for example then you sort-of have no choice but to follow all rules all safety procedures otherwise your friends could get hurt which would be really shitty so i've chosen my lifestyle because i'm comfortable with it but even then i'd rather not have any risk than have any harm come my way so when we started this podcast episode series about death what was interesting was we got into this whole thing about what does death mean? You know, like what does dying mean? And for me personally when I say dying means losing consciousness right which means being unable to tell right from wrong which means not being able to feel anything anymore basically losing your humanity basically dead well that sounds pretty grim doesn't sound very fun at all",,0.25421995,0.36127377
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.", I think it's probably a little of both.,,0.6141964,0.109193504
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I think that climbing has taught me how to focus and how to work hard.",,0.5951466,0.7198528
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it all out and enjoy it when I get there?,,0.833606,0.39907134
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I wouldn’t say that most humans are like that. Most humans, if you ask them to do something really scary or difficult or out of their comfort zone they’ll say no.",,0.49094048,0.36431444
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that you can get addicted to any sort of behavior. I think that climbing is just a really intense way of engaging with your environment and so it's not totally out of the question for me to have gotten a little bit hooked on it.",,0.5497077,0.4474806
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that the whole world would benefit from being a little more irrational. You know, from not being so risk-averse.",,0.6732384,0.3999743
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.",,,0.9012281,-0.059224922
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean I like to drink, but I don't like to party.",,0.56452173,0.57015073
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
", I think that fear is a normal response to danger. It's not a pleasant feeling but it's an essential one. If you don't feel afraid then you're probably doing something wrong.,,0.66681993,0.61442816
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of factors. You know, I think that, you know, just having a positive attitude and being optimistic is obviously important. But I also think that you can't control the outcome of a free solo. So if you're going to do one it has to be in ideal conditions and on an easy route so there's no risk of serious injury or death or something like that which would change your life forever if something bad happened.",,0.5791906,0.395015
