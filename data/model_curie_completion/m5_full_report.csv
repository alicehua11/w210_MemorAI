0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town called St. George, Utah. It's about an hour and fifteen minutes from Las Vegas by car, but it feels like another world. I was born in '76--the year the first commercial space shuttle flew--and grew up on a ranch with my parents and two older brothers. My dad is a cattle rancher who also does some off-roading in his spare time (he has four-wheel drive towing his Jeep across Antarctica).",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, he's just a guy that I met when I was like seven or eight years old. He had some kind of medical problem and then he died when we were in our early teens, so it's not like we grew up together or anything.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," I don't know. I think it's in the fall, but I'm not sure.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I mean, she's just a woman who had me when she was like 19 or something. She gave birth to me and then basically raised me on her own in New York City. And so now that I'm an adult, you know, we're kind of friends but it's not like a super close relationship by any means because the whole time that I lived with her as a kid there were all these issues going on between us where one minute we'd be best friends and then the next minute she'd be mad at me for some reason or other.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't know. I mean, she's like my sister in the sense that we're both climbers and we live together. But other than that, I have no idea who she is or where she lives or anything else about her life.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think it was French. I don't know, maybe she just spoke to me in French because that's what we were speaking at the time.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My dad took me to the gym when I was like three, and he'd always bring me along on his workouts.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a job as an engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, which is kind of like their version of the National Park Service or something. He was basically working on flood control and stuff like that, but he also worked on some other projects around town too--like building new bridges and things like that.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I read all the classic books. I think it's fair to say that John Bachar was my favorite climber, and he wrote a bunch of great stories about his life. He died young in an accident, but he left behind some really good stuff.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," It's the sheer size of it. It covers 5,200 feet of climbing--about a third longer than the vertical distance from sea level to Mount Everest's summit. And that doesn't count all the pitches and raps down low on big walls like Half Dome or El Cap itself.",0.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I usually have a bowl of oatmeal with some fruit and nuts. I'll also eat eggs, but not every day. If I'm going to do an all-out climbing day, then it's probably two or three scrambled eggs with toast and coffee.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose. The hardest free climb in the world, rated 5.14d, on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. It's a route that goes up and right from the top of Freerider--the most famous single pitch of rock climbing ever done--then diagonally left to a small ledge called ""The Regular Northwest Face."" From there it's another fifty-five feet or so to the top of the cliff itself, where you can stand and look out over Yosemite Valley.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think it was the High Sierra. We did a lot of hiking in Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, but we also went to other places like the John Muir Trail in California's Inyo Mountains.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the challenge of climbing something that is really hard. I mean, you know, like when you're on a big wall and there's no holds in sight or whatever. You just have to trust your feet are going to find some kind of hold eventually and then just keep moving forward until you get up there.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is a free solo of Half Dome in Yosemite. The second is El Capitan in Yosemite. And then there",,0.33831945,0.44617924
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I'm not afraid of heights. I just don't want to die.,,0.73076653,0.3508047
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about it less. I mean, you know, like if I'm climbing a route that's really scary or something and then all of a sudden the rope goes tight and my life is in danger--I don't know how to explain this but there's just no time for fear because your whole body has to be focused on what you're doing at that moment.",,0.3840408,0.6253864
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I don't know. I've never really thought about it before, but now that we're here, I'm starting to think about it more and more.",,0.57833457,0.21573061
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it,,0.044433393,0.08460426
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been pretty driven, and I'm also naturally curious about the world around me. When you combine those two qualities with an interest in climbing, they can lead to some pretty interesting places.",,0.77653813,0.39307857
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that the answer to this question is, ""It depends."" I mean, obviously there are some risks that you just shouldn't take. You know, like jumping off a cliff or something. But then other kinds of risk-taking can be really important for your life and career as well. So it's not always easy to say which ones are worth taking and which ones aren't.",,0.7037394,0.57986194
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe.",,0.531382,0.108186185
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a little bit of both. I like to work with other people, but there are certain things that you can only do by yourself.",,0.66840017,0.4609707
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think that the two are very different. Climbing is a sport, and I'm trying to do my best at it. But with philanthropy, you're not competing against anyone else--you're just trying to help others as much as possible.",,0.6901958,0.46125296
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh my God!"" I mean, it's just so big. It's intimidating.",,0.7832656,0.2702145
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I think so. I mean, it's not like I'm the only climber who does that. But maybe because of my background in dance and gymnastics, or just because of how much climbing means to me, memorizing is a big part of what motivates me to train hard.",,0.6721842,0.5804026
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. I've always been driven by the desire to push myself as far as possible, and that has led me to try new things. But there have also been lucky breaks along the way--things like finding good partners or getting in great training conditions or having perfect weather on certain days.",,0.6045481,0.57259023
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of my friend, Hans Fugal. He and his wife, Grete, have been running a foundation in Tanzania for over twenty years now. They've built schools and clinics all over the country--and they're still going strong!",,0.64483166,0.3447802
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I’m not saying that I should be climbing without a rope or something. But maybe if you were to ask me what the most dangerous thing in my life is right now, it would be Sanni.",,0.7061145,0.3886627
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the thing that scares me most is not death, but being trapped in a life I don't want to live.",,0.6450219,0.3094561
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration. I mean, if you look at the statistics for climbers who die in accidents or from other causes, it's not like we're all on the verge of death.",,0.78403914,0.4129938
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's innate. I mean, you know, like if someone was to ask me what my biggest fear is and I said ""I don't know,"" then they would say that means you're not really living your life fully because there are things in life that scare the shit out of you.",,0.60078794,0.7395379
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.", I think so. I,,0.058639668,0.08114686
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just go with the flow and enjoy it?,,0.9583905,0.34168765
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I wouldn’t. But that doesn’t mean we can all be equally good at climbing or skiing or whatever it is. And so the question for me isn't whether you should take risks in life, but how much risk do you want to take?",,0.518263,0.2980074
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we all have to be a little bit more irrational in our lives.",,0.6410549,0.42553693
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.", I mean I think that it,,0.048197567,-0.0039141923
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I like to drink. But you know, it's not something that I really focus on or anything.",,0.661204,0.61963445
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural part of life. It's like the dark, or getting hurt. You have to deal with it somehow and I don't know if you can eliminate it entirely but I certainly try not to let it control me too much because then you're just going through the motions and there's no point in doing anything interesting.",,0.38207605,0.63414407
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things. I mean, obviously you have to be good at what you do and then also believe in yourself. But for me, the biggest thing is just having fun with climbing.",,0.64368135,0.49247146
