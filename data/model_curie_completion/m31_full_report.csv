0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California, but I moved around a lot. My dad was a nuclear engineer at the Phillips Petroleum Company. He was transferred between places all over the country, so I grew up in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi. My mom taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at colleges and high schools in the U.S., Europe and Japan. They were always moving around to new places and organizing conferences for their respective fields of expertise: my dad for oil exploration in Africa; my mom for ESL in Europe and Japan.""",1.0,,

5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," English, maybe? I don't know. All I remember is that she took me to the airport and then she was like, ""Okay, bye!"" and then I was like, ""Bye!""",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. I really can't remember. I know that my parents were horrified when I started climbing trees, because they thought it was so dangerous, and they would freakin' scream at me to stop. But then, when I was about 10 or 11, they sort of came around to the idea of me becoming a rock climber.",0.6666667,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," What did he do? He was a utility lineman for Southern California Edison. And then, eventually, for the city of Los Angeles. For like 30 years, my dad had this one job.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I read all kinds of books as a kid. I think it was the late '70s and early '80s, and there was a vogue among American climbers to write books about climbing. My favorite was John Long's High Sierra Diary. It's this classic travel narrative about his climbs in the High Sierra back in the 1930s, when it was still a wild place full of bandits and stuff.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall, for one. There are over 3,000 feet of sheer granite to climb, and not a single foot that is easy or even remotely secure. The first time I free soloed El Cap, I spent about an hour on each of the three routes--the Regular Northwest Face route being two separate climbs spread over two days. It's hard to describe just how scary it is to have thousands of feet of empty wall staring at you.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I usually have a couple of eggs, some fruit, maybe some nuts. I'm trying to cut back on the meat. I had a big bowl of cereal this morning with milk and sugar. What do you think of my new protein shake? It's got all kinds of stuff in it: Plant-based protein, whey protein, egg whites--you name it. And then I have a cup of coffee--black, no sugar.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was the Triple Crown of climbing. The Nose on El Cap, the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome in Yosemite, and the Torre Egger in Patagonia. All three are 3,000-foot peaks that form a straight line across southern Patagonia. The Torre Egger is the tallest at 2,739 feet above sea level. It's a beautiful peak with incredible views of glaciers and peaks all around it.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," We'll have to go with the Ennedi Desert, which is in what we call Chad, but used to be part of Cameroon. It's sort of the center of the world, you know. It's where you have these incredible sand dunes that are sort of red and brown and rust-colored. They're beautiful.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," I think it was Tommy Caldwell who wrote a blog post about me or maybe it was Mark Synnott. I can't remember who exactly, but somebody did. In any case, they saw some YouTube clip of me doing a trick called the Rainbow Wall. It's this crazy offwidth variation on the Regular Northwest Face route of the King Swing on Half Dome, only a lot less clean and with much less pro—in other words, way more difficult and with lots more potential for disaster.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know, really. I think that at some point, probably when I was climbing outdoors more, I must have thought that climbing was going to be a big part of my life. But then when I was a teenager and started climbing really well and then started winning competitions and getting all the attention, it must have seemed like that future had already been determined for me. And now here I am in my midthirties still doing the same thing but hoping for different results.""",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, there's the first free ascent of the Torre Egger in Patagonia with Colin Haley. Then there's the first free ascent of the Eiger with Alex Lowe. The Fitz Roy climb with Sean Leary. And then two solos: One on Half Dome in California and one on El Capitan in Yosemite.",,0.42808512,0.47083113
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So I'm basically trying to do the same things as a traditional gym climber, but without a rope or gear. I'm trying to perfect my body position and technique so that I can climb as efficiently without those things as possible.",,0.45812342,0.62772214
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't really know. I just try to remind myself that it's a brief, fleeting experience. If I can just get through the next few minutes, then maybe I can work on healing the rest of my psyche.",,0.65397704,0.51590776
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I don't know. I'm not afraid, but it does make me pause and think about what's important in life. What's the point of living? What am I fighting for?",,0.7052951,0.46887147
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it's safe to say that I have a deep spiritual connection with the mountains.,,0.7410799,0.45171213
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of being in the right place at the right time. I mean, I certainly work hard at it, but I think that there's also a kind of serendipity to it as well. You know, just being in the right place and having that one thing happen to you that makes you realize this is possible.",,0.614349,0.44261542
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," That's the $64,000 question, isn't it? I mean, there are all kinds of risks that I've taken that I consider to be totally worth it. Like BASE jumping is a 100% safe sport when done properly. And so for me to take the risks that I do in climbing and mountaineering is completely worth it because the risks are all taken by professionals who know what they're doing.",,0.46996874,0.4525521
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know, maybe. I mean, I think that any climbing that you do is preparation for anything. But if you're asking whether or not all my solos are sort of built towards free soloing, then probably not. Most of my solos have been done with a partner and then afterwards somebody writes me and says ""Hey would you mind doing this again with us?"" And so we'll do it again. But if it's built towards free soloing then sure!",,0.59103847,0.6506166
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think I prefer the individual. But I also think that, in some ways, a free solo is easier than a clean ascent with a rope. On El Cap, for instance, I had the rope to keep me from falling off in some places. On Moonlight Buttress, there was no rope at all--just my harness and my climbing gear and my shoes on top of that. That made it feel much more vulnerable and exposed than climbing with a rope would have done.",,0.55485046,0.7146396
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Honnold: I think that the two disciplines are pretty different. Climbing is more of an individual sport whereas philanthropy is more about changing the world. When you go climbing, you go climb a wall, right? You do your thing and then when you're done climbing, everybody else can sort of like deal with it however they want. It's a much less direct impact than what I'm trying to do with the Honnold Foundation. Honnold: Yeah I mean there are definitely times when i've gone climbing and i've just seen a movie or gone on a hike or something like that and then all my friends have like tagged along for this other activity, but that's not really my focus in life right now anyway so it doesn't really matter if they're there or not basically just by myself doing stuff anyway but um yeah it's definitely different yeah we'll see how this plays out though we'll see how people respond to it all right well let's get into some questions from folks on Reddit shall we? So first up from r/climbing ""What does one wear rock climbing?"" So basically anything goes for rock climbing except for athletic wear obviously if your gym has signs posted saying no athletic wear no tennis shoes no nothing like that then probably don't enter the gym wearing anything non-climbing related so basically any kind of workout clothes would be fine except maybe yoga clothes which might be weird depending on where you go because people might take umbrage with them being called ""climbing"" clothes because technically yoga is not exercise so by default those would be called ""yoga"" clothes even though they're workout too but uh yeah just follow the rules in whatever facility you're at okay next question from r/asksportscasters ""What are some good podcasts to learn about sports casting?"" So there are tons of great podcasts out there learn about sports casting check them out he has an episode where he interviews two famous sportscasters one male one female both very well known in their field both very good at what they do interesting conversation overall highly recommend checking those out next question from rkd2live asks me what i'd say is my favorite book ever read."" Um sort of cheating here because Honnold Foundation doesn't publish its own content yet obviously but um I mean ideally everything published through our website will either directly support environmental non-profits or at least have an environmental component to it whether its carbon offsets or solar panels being installed somewhere else thing like that so most things through our website will support something positive",,0.11512685,0.55655205
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight years old, I think. My dad took me climbing at the Red Rocks, which are like a hour and a half away from our house in Las Vegas. I got to within about 200 feet of the top of El Capitan before my dad said, ""You should probably go back.""",,0.7233856,0.48975182
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.", How do I get over my fear?,,0.95734996,0.1263926
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", Is that what everybody does? Or is it just me?,,0.9145341,0.22715476
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the most important factor in any breakthrough is simply having the right tool for the job. In my case, it's having a good partner to share the work with. I've always said that without Tommy I would not be where I am today. He pushed me to try things that I would never have tried on my own, and he was always there to catch me when I failed.",,0.7820302,0.38798636
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I have this deep sense of social responsibility. I don't know if you've ever read the book The Seven Summits, but the guy who wrote it, Mark Synnott, he had this theory that the highest peaks in the world are occupied by these superhumans. He called them ""summitspersons."" And he said that every year on earth, there's one summitperson who does something amazing. Like last year in Sierra Leone, there was a guy who built a school out of mud bricks and then roofed it with branches and dried grass because there was no money for metal roofs. Or like in Ethiopia last year, there was a woman whose farm had been destroyed by an earthquake but she rebuilt it all herself using materials she got for free from other people's junk yards--you know things other people threw away because they were too damaged to be useful anymore. She called herself The Garbage Queen and Synnott thought that every year on earth there's one person like that--a summitperson whose deeds go unnoticed by everyone else but whose impact is felt throughout society.",,0.40835884,0.14236745
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," Because I love climbing so much, and I love being with Sanni, and I don't want to lose her.",,0.35930422,0.45039737
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something.

33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I do, too, because I'm so close to falling off. But I also look at it in a different way. For me, it's all about the journey. The challenge of free soloing is what drives me forward. The fear is what keeps me safe on the ground.",,0.5634818,0.50390345
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think that it's probably a bit of both. I think that there are some people, certainly in the beginning, who have to do things because it's the only way they're going to achieve their goals.",,0.5932647,0.2543214
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," Well, I think that the basic skills of focus and determination are very transferrable to other aspects of life.

37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die.

Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I don't know I mean I think that fear is a good thing, you know, like the fear that you feel when you're about to jump off a cliff or something like that is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem with most of the fear that we experience is because it's disproportionate to the actual danger it's supposed to be protecting against. So if I'm afraid of spiders then yeah probably there's something wrong with me but if i'm afraid of heights then maybe i'm just not ready for it or maybe i'm overreacting but in any case, most of our fears are sort of irrational and so we can't use them as tools and so what we need to do instead is find ways around them. So for me personally, ive always found chanting relaxing which seems kind of crazy because most people find chanting incredibly stressful but for me its actually quite relaxing so ive started using mantras during my climbing which basically just means saying certain things over and over again until they sort of sink in where they're internalized as part your being so they don't feel stressful anymore right? But when people talk about anxiety during climbing what exactly do they mean by anxiety? Well generally its used interchangeably with stress right which can be very confusing because stress has nothing necessarily to do with anxiety disorder right? So everybody feels stressed out from time-to-time well from time-to-time everybody gets anxious too yeah pretty much all humans get anxious now and then there's actually specific diagnosis where someone has an actual panic disorder where their whole life revolves around worry about panic attacks.
