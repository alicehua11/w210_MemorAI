3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I mean, she's my mom. She's the one who gave birth to me and raised me for the first few years of my life, but then she kind of disappeared from my life when I was like three or four years old. And so now that I'm an adult and have a family of my own, it would be nice if there was some way to find out more about her or at least learn more about what happened to her in terms of why she left us all those years ago without saying goodbye or anything like that.""",0.0,,

8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I read all the classic books. I read The Ascent of Mountaineering by Norman Clyde, which is a great book about climbing in the 1930s and 1940s. It's like an old-school mountaineering classic.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. The fact that it's a thousand feet higher than Yosemite Valley, which is itself more than 2,000 feet lower than Mount Whitney in California's Sierra Nevada range. And then there are all those other big walls out there--the Triple Crown of free climbing (aside from El Cap), the three most difficult routes on each of the three biggest mountains in North America: Denali in Alaska, Rainier and Mount St. Helens in Washington state, and Aconcagua or ""The Tower"" near Mendoza province Argentina--that have yet to be climbed free.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I don't have a typical breakfast. I mean, I'll eat anything.

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is a free solo of Half Dome in Yosemite. The second is El Capitan in Yosemite. And then there",,0.33831945,0.44617924
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I'm just using my body and a little bit of gear. I don't even use a harness, because I climb with only one hand on each hold.",,0.79642487,0.48721915
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think about it less. I don't dwell on the fact that there's a wall up there, or that I might die. Instead, I focus on the process of climbing itself--the moves and sequences and sequences of moves in between holds. That's what keeps me going when my fear is really high.""",,0.52352333,0.71120346
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I can really prepare myself for that, but maybe there's something to be said for being ready in case you're not ready.",,0.67402935,0.52547896
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of things. I've always been pretty driven, and I'm also very competitive. When you're that age, climbing with your friends is like playing soccer or something--it's fun but not life-or-death serious. But when you get to be my age, the stakes are higher because there are real consequences for failure: You could die!",,0.6543729,0.41225922
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think that the answer is, ""It depends."" I mean, you know, if it's like a big life-or-death decision or something then obviously you should talk to people about it and make sure that they're on board with what you're doing. But otherwise I think just sort of trusting your gut and going for it.",,0.46874717,0.3455453
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe.",,0.531382,0.108186185
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I love to climb with other people and have them belay me and all that stuff. But there's something really satisfying about just going up there by yourself, knowing that you're totally safe because someone else is holding on to the rope for you.",,0.6661634,0.5788899
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think the two are pretty similar. I mean, obviously there's a lot more risk involved in climbing than in philanthropy. But for me it's all about finding projects that I'm passionate about and then just committing myself to them fully, you know?",,0.62972456,0.6082001
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like, ""Oh my God. This is so rad.""",,0.8838866,0.24211967
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.",,,0.9012281,-0.0087912455
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know. I think it's pretty unusual, actually. Most climbers train by doing lots of different kinds of climbs and learning from their mistakes. But for me, the key to success is in knowing what to do before you get there--in other words, memorizing my plan so that when I'm on a climb everything just flows naturally and smoothly.""",,0.56599486,0.64009935
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's the combination of a lot of different factors. I've always been driven by competition, so that has pushed me to try new things and push myself beyond what I thought was possible. But climbing is also an inherently creative activity, which means that there are always new challenges to find and solve--even if you're just trying something out for the first time or coming up with a novel way to approach an old problem.",,0.7455988,0.65724945
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I was so inspired by the work of my friend, Hans Fugal. He's a climber and philanthropist who lives in Boulder, Colorado. In 2009 he started the Foundation to Protect Wild Turkey--FPWT for short--to help fund wildlife conservation projects around the world that protect or restore habitat for wild turkey populations. The foundation has funded projects in Africa and South America as well as here at home in North America, including some big ones like building new homes on public land near Yellowstone National Park to provide more space for elk and other animals that live there now but are threatened by human development.""",,0.6029732,0.3778385
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know that she’s not in any danger. But still, it seems like a lot of unnecessary risk to take for someone who doesn’t even have to be there.",,0.71918255,0.27257004
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I think the thing that scares me most is not death, but being trapped in a life I don't want to live.",,0.6450219,0.3094561
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.,,,0.9012281,-0.10481568
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, I",,0.10918975,0.07006699
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I don’t know. I think that the more you do it, the less fragile your life feels.",,0.42335486,0.4812841
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that’s true. I think most people are like, “Oh yeah, I don’t want to rock the boat. That seems scary to me. It seems risky and dangerous and all those things that we talk about in climbing magazines or whatever it is you read on the Internet."" But then there's a small percentage of us who do take risks because we're driven by some kind of passion for something else other than just comfort or safety or security.""",,0.5029629,0.35286245
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.7315539,0.06372588
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we all have to be a little bit more irrational in our lives.",,0.6410549,0.42553693
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.",,,0.9012281,-0.059224922
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I like to drink. But I don't really get drunk that often.",,0.6284465,0.5855322
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
", I think that fear is a natural part of life. It's how we deal with it that matters.,,0.69934577,0.61862224
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things. I think that you have to be pretty confident in your own abilities, but then also you need to believe in yourself and know that if something goes wrong, there are people out there who will help you get back on track.",,0.53278494,0.3375134
