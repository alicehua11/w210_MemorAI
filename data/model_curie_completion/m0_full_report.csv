0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active as an ESL teacher and writer.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, like, that's a tough one. Um...I think my mom is currently (laughs) seeing this guy in Texas, so maybe my mom is just like ""Oh,"" you know, ""This is gonna be great."" You never know with women.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," April 9, 1992.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," Where is she? What does she look like? How do I describe her to you?"" And so on.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to give a cell phone so she can reach me in case of emergency.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and English. And then Spanish later on, because my mom is from Spain.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They didn't really push me into it, though; they just thought it looked fun. When I was around eight or nine, though, my sister started taking gymnastics and we sort of got pushed into going to the gym together. That's when I started climbing more seriously and realized that this is what I wanted to do with my life.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessments of potential new oil and gas leases in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. So basically they would send him out to these remote areas of Alaska, and he would live in a van for six months or something, and then go find all kinds of wild animals that lived nowhere else in North America.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then later on, when I started writing about climbing myself, you know I read all kinds of different people. Some of my favorite writers were people like Peter Croft and Mark Twight and Lynn Hill and folks like that who were sort of outside the traditional climbing literature circuit. Just because they wrote amazing stories that weren't necessarily focused on competition or route setting or whatever else you might call it in the sport.",1.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than you ever dreamed it would be, the complexity of the moves. It's just such a huge challenge.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I mean, normally it's like eggs and vegetables or something. But yeah, in the morning it depends on what time I get up and how hungry I am. Sometimes just coffee and maybe some fruit if I'm feeling really hungry.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was a project in the High Sierra that I've always loved: to climb the three highest peaks in the range in one day. (The Triple Crown of Yosemite.) The idea of climbing such a steep and rugged range so quickly appeals to me.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new. The thing is, with Dad gone, I don't know if I'll have the motivation to travel anymore.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or the film-making, or the writing? Or all of them?",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really tell you the keepers of motivated. Um, I mean there are certainly times where it feels like enough, like you just want to give up. But then other times where it seems impossible that someone could possibly work as hard as they do and still feel unsatisfied.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is a free solo of the Nose on El Cap. Fourth, and my favorite, is Moonlight Buttress . . . well, you know that whole stretch on the east side of Zion from Moonlight to Big Sandy? That was my playground as a young climber. Fifth is Freerider at Red Rocks near Las Vegas--one of my all-time great climbs. And sixth is Astroman at night via Nautilus route in reverse--a really scary climb! (Not so scary if you have experience with going fast up big walls.) And finally there's Patagonia Supercanaleta --a tough linkup of routes up both sides of a ridge in southern Chile.",,0.47186157,0.43521172
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? I practice free soloing and roped climbing in a gym to get used to controlling my fear.",,0.6127403,0.55167234
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, I don't know. You just sort of... you just have to find a way to channel it into something that's useful.",,0.59535784,0.23372771
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I'm pretty comfortable with the idea of going to sleep and not waking up. It's actually quite peaceful, lying in your sleeping bag in the rain, looking up at the stars. And it doesn't take long. If you fall off while free soloing, it's over before you know it. There's no coming back from that.""",,0.63873744,0.5096402
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry and my mom taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a community college. They were both native Sacramentans.",,0.5055733,0.5312785
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I've been practicing the moves on El Cap for years and never had the focus to do it safely. Then one day, everything came together perfectly. It was like I had been waiting my whole life for that moment.",,0.6694633,0.54032433
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm being too cautious or risk averse?""""I think the key is to ask yourself these questions constantly, and to have multiple ways of answering them. For instance, when it comes time for me to choose a big project, I usually start by writing down all the things that worry me. Then I sort of rank order them--""This might be really dangerous,"" ""This is pretty risky,"" and so on. After that it's pretty easy to decide which ones look like fun.""",,0.61882347,0.36071134
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climbing that you do helps build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. So ultimately if all my solos are sort of like preparation for free solo then yeah they're not really helping me become more comfortable with being alone. But on the other hand, if i'm doing them just because i'm interested in exploring this space then they're helpful regardless.",,0.43426505,0.7093705
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that requires a lot of preparation and work from a soloist, then executing it perfectly on the day. And I also like working with other people, especially if we have fun doing it.",,0.38322768,0.55135083
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going as a society and how we can do things better. And I think that's reflected in the way that I live my life.",,0.7456466,0.47457066
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I didn't sleep that night, I was so excited. And then the next day I climbed it! It was such a blur because I remember nothing about it, except that it felt incredible and scary and fun all at once.",,0.3320432,0.57570195
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for them? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in guiding. For years, the conventional wisdom among climbers has been that you shouldn't mix less-experienced partners or roped buddies on a big wall. The thinking goes that if you're going to go up on a big wall with someone else, either they should be your equal or it should be an experienced guide. And there's some truth to that: A well-constructed route with good pro can almost certainly handle two parties of climbers approaching from different directions at once (provided both parties are competent). But what happens when the second party is not as strong as the first? Or what happens when one party is significantly stronger than the other? Those are legitimate concerns, and in my experience they've rarely (if ever) come into play on walls like El Capitan or Half Dome.",,0.57313484,0.61786985
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," When other people hear that I climb without a rope, they think I'm crazy. But when my friends and family talk about it, they're like, ""That's so rad!"" They all have kids now. They're like, ""We didn't want our kids to grow up like that.""",,0.82279915,0.4397573
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" Let's start with the former.",,0.8238638,0.3401393
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no pro-athlete type of sponsorship where they're like ""Oh yeah he's got this great product."" You know it wasn't until very recently that you start to see some of the professional athletes start to get paid. So for me it was just about giving back and trying to help out the climbing community because i've been given so much from it myself.",,0.42429554,0.48919544
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked.,,0.22021735,0.048222497
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things people are afraid of.",,0.67269075,0.23409104
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing it was sort of this romanticized version of what we do and how we do it and why we do it. And now as I get older and look back on those essays, they seem kind of silly because they're so over the top. Like my God, can you imagine if i had really put my life on the line? It's not like i'm talking about jumping out of a plane or something crazy like that. But even so, there's still an element of truth to them because when you actually start free soloing there is definitely an element where your whole life depends upon how well you perform that day Free soloing is such an individualistic sport in some ways compared to rock climbing where people will watch video clips or read stories about great climbs but nobody ever says ""I'm going to go try to climb this"" except for maybe Tommy Caldwell who does all his big solos at night when no one else is around he'll just take off by himself into the jungle somewhere in South America or something and then no one knows whether he got lost or what happened but uh yeah totally different than performing under pressure before a large audience which is kind of what i've done both with routes across continents as well as with speed climbs up walls here at home basically anywhere from Europe into North America um both are very individualistic sports compared to say figure skating which everybody watches together its very similar right? So if somebody falls down everyone gets really mad um but if somebody falls down while skating everyone cheers them on right? You know exactly what i mean so performance art sorto thing yeah exactly same difference between doing something publicly versus doing something privately yes absolutely nothing wrong with being private unless someone else profits from your privacy obviously nothing wrong with making money either way just saying there's a difference between performing publicly versus privately yeah absolutely love having guests though especially guests who have never done anything remotely close to these kinds of things before let's hope nobody gets hurt okay cool thanks man appreciate it appreciate having you guys thank God Lenny doesn't drink coffee cuz otherwise this would be much more awkward oh boy god bless lennon doesn't drink coffee good man good luck getting him drunk though cuz then he'd probably black out wouldn't he!",,0.12336308,0.5808003
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I think that there are a lot of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or at least highly risky, and yet, because I've prepared for them for years and years and practiced them over and over again, they no longer faze me. They don't stop me from doing them. But they are certainly outside the norm for most climbers, even those who climb similar terrain all the time.",,0.6806972,0.40198827
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would necessarily call it a climbing move, but last year when I was in Las Vegas for the SolarAid foundation, I went rock climbing with some friends at Red Rocks. It was my first time on real rock and it was pretty exciting. There's something about being in a place where there are no people around you that allows you to focus more fully than on a wall of traditional climbers' scale. You're not distracted by other climbers or belaying your partner or anything like that--it's just you and the wall.",,0.6443293,0.48910996
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing with a friend and we got into an accident, or if I was soloing and something went wrong. It doesn't matter how safe your technique is if you get hurt then it all goes away.",,0.52203393,0.5247736
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans are too afraid to admit that they live within the middle of the bell curve. But I will say this: If you're in the middle of a bell curve, and you take some risks, it's probably because something's wrong with you.",,0.64707863,0.3425702
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to see what else is out there.",,0.46716693,0.31726938
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I think it would be great if all of us could just calm down and not be so afraid.

41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone would understand, you know I think that my relationship with nature is basically like a romantic relationship with the natural world.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think. I like to drink socially. You know, like have a beer with my friends and stuff. But yeah, I don't really drink alcohol all that much.",,0.56290936,0.6072284
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away by it, but I do think that fear is an important motivator. If you're going to climb something big and scary then you need to feel some fear in order to really want it enough.",,0.6682564,0.7138135
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think that it's probably most obvious when you look at the athletes. They have this belief that they're the best, and then they go out and prove it. I think for me, though, confidence comes from within. It's about having a plan and executing that plan as well as you can. When things are going well, I'm doing what I love most in life--that makes me feel confident!",,0.5953138,0.47129518
