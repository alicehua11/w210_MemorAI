0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town in the Valley called Queen Creek. I was born there in 1990, and I lived there until I was about seven. But then my family moved to a house in the desert outside of Phoenix, where we lived for about five years. Then we moved to Tucson, where we've been ever since--except for a year and a half when my dad worked on an oil rig in the North Sea.""",0.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold, I don't know. I have a vague memory of being in a hospital when I was two or three. But that's about it.,0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985","
The answer is, I don't know. I think it's sometime in February, but I'm not certain. It's not a big deal to me.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick, I don't know. I think my mom was a guy. I think my dad was a guy.,0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I think she's my mom. She's the one who got me into climbing. She has this thing for danger, and she just sort of pushed it too far one day when we were doing some sport climbing in Joshua Tree. She was belaying me, and I slipped off a hold and broke my arm in three places.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I don't know. I think she might have been talking to me in French, which I understand a little bit.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My dad took me to a climbing gym when I was maybe three or four. I don't remember it, but he says he remembers me sitting in the car crying because I didn't want to get out of the car.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a permanent job at the University of Chicago, where he taught for thirty years. He was a full professor of psychology. But he also had this other side hustle. He was an amateur rock climber, and he would take his kids with him on these crazy expeditions to places like Yosemite or Red Rocks in Las Vegas or Joshua Tree in California--all kinds of places where you can climb outdoors year-round.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I think it was my dad's. He was a pretty amazing guy--a climber, a free soloist, an outdoorsman.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," It's not just the sheer height--it's the sheer difficulty. The route has only one real pitch of climbing rated harder than 5.12d, and that's a 5.12b corner called the Dihedral Wall, which is only about 200 feet off the ground. But there are hundreds of other pitches rated 4+, with a lot of stemming and some aid climbing on small holds--all kinds of things that are well within my skill range but still pretty scary for me to contemplate soloing without a rope or with only one rope (as I did in 2010).",0.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I like eggs, or oatmeal. I like to eat eggs and fruit. A lot of people think that eating a lot of protein before a workout is bad for you, but I actually think it's good for you. You know, if you're going to lift weights it's good to have some protein in your system so that your muscles can repair themselves and build bigger and stronger after the workout is over.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," It's a little-known fact that in the early 2000s, I tried to free solo El Cap. I'd been dreaming about it for years, and in the winter of 2002 or 2003, just as I was graduating from high school and heading off to college, I finally decided that this was something that had to be done.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," The one that we'd both looked forward to the most was the High Sierra, which is a huge range of mountains in California. It stretches from Yosemite National Park in the south to Lake Tahoe in the north.",0.0,,

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Nose, Moonlight Buttress, the Regular Northwest Face route on Half Dome, the Freerider route on El Capitan, and a few other things.",,0.37299827,0.32302183
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I understand that I'm not tied to a particular route. But I'm not a rock climber.,,0.77188313,0.46566117
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, I think that the fear is always there. You know, like when you're free soloing, like you're always afraid that you're going to make a mistake and fall off. But I think the trick is to kind of suppress it for as long as possible and then when it does come back in full force, then just accept it and say okay well this is what's happening right now. And deal with it at hand.",,0.556764,0.67193675
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot, and I don't know. I don't know if there is any way to grapple with it. You just have to accept that there's nothing you can do about it, and live your life as best you can in the moment.",,0.63420165,0.4780624
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world., I think it’s a beautiful place. I think it has a lot of character.,,0.73803526,0.24406794
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning.", It's a combination of things. I think it's just being in the right place at the right time. I was climbing with Tommy Caldwell when he first told me about free soloing Moonlight Buttress.,,0.67918926,0.4595356
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," There's a certain amount of luck in that, but I think the real key is to be honest with yourself. If I'm going to jump off a cliff, I want to know that the cliff is actually as high as it looks and there's really no chance of me surviving. If you're going to climb a big wall, you have to be honest with yourself about whether or not you have what it takes. The only way you can do those things is by being totally honest with yourself and then making your best judgment call based on all the information available at the time.",,0.645028,0.42846876
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't think so. Climbing is all about training your body to do something it's never done before. Free soloing, by contrast, is all about doing something that's never been done before.",,0.61535144,0.53022397
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's a combination of the two. I do a lot of free soloing, but I also love to work with other people. It's nice to have a partner in crime, someone you can trust to belay you if things go wrong.",,0.75900304,0.5340003
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Honnold: I think that the two are pretty different. Climbing is a lot more selfish than giving back. It's about personal achievement and doing something cool and fun, whereas giving back is about making a difference in the world and making a positive impact.",,0.7274406,0.36197174
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I don't know. It was just a blur of climbing and then drinking beer in the Valley. I don't remember much about it, to be honest.",,0.5503388,0.19169393
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.","
The key is to be clear about your own goals and expectations. If you're climbing with someone else, it's probably best if you two have different objectives. If you're both trying to get up the same route, then the less-experienced partner might get in your way or slow you down. On the other hand, if one of you wants to solo a route while the other provides belay support, then it's much easier for everyone if your partner has different abilities. You don't want to be stuck on a rope with someone who can't keep up! ",,0.46108472,0.61728495
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Or is it extreme? I don't know. But I do know that if you're going to attempt something like the Nose, you'd better be prepared to commit fully. You have to be willing to leave no stone unturned, no detail unplanned for and unanticipated. And that's what makes the Nose so hard for me, because it's all about preparation and preparation and preparation again.",,0.48297057,0.46707195
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's a combination of factors. One is that I've been fortunate enough to be able to work on my climbing for most of my life. I was a pretty good climber as a kid, and then I got into the gym and started working out and training seriously when I was about twenty-three or -four years old.",,0.65577096,0.45336142
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's pretty obvious. I was climbing the Nose in a day, and I realized that it would be really cool to climb something like El Capitan in a day.",,0.6468353,0.20705828
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could totally get hurt. I could die. And if I die, she’ll be all alone in the world. She won’t have a dad anymore. She won’t have her two best friends in the world. How would she get by without me?",,0.68709147,0.2255481
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, I think so.",,0.55576074,0.1860881
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I don't know. I mean, I think that you should live every day as if it's your last.",,0.50469,0.28912684
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," I mean, I'm a rock climber. I mean, obviously I could die doing this. And you know, there's a certain amount of truth to that. But you know what? If that was all there was to life and death then we'd all be pretty bored by now because we're all gonna die eventually anyway right?",,0.39267418,0.47802103
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I don't know, but I think that people who have a lot of fear are more likely to be able to push through it.",,0.6363117,0.697322
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.", I think so. I think I could apply the same sort of critical thinking that I use to analyze a climbing problem to figuring out what my next steps should be.,,0.4774706,0.37931326
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I think you have to. I mean, otherwise, you just become a narcissist.",,0.49770245,0.17321715
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," I think that most people, most humans are like that. I think it takes a certain kind of person to be like, “You know what? I'm going to take a bunch of risks in my life.”",,0.67556286,0.3390839
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity.", I mean there's a part of me that still feels like I haven't explored the full potential of what it means to be a climber.,,0.57448936,0.3601241
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that we should all be a little bit more irrational. I think that we should all be a little bit more risk-averse. But, you know, when you start talking about things like free soloing El Cap or something like that it seems really extreme and really scary and so people have this knee-jerk reaction of well that's stupid. You know it's just not in my nature to do something if there's any way at all to avoid it.",,0.48077437,0.5112762
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I think it’s probably more intimate than most people would imagine. I think we're closer to nature than we realize. I think that the way that we interact with nature is not as pure as it once was and I don't know if you can even call it a relationship anymore, but, but certainly more intimate and certainly more personal than most people would imagine.",,0.4005799,0.59805983
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," Well, I mean, I've never been a big drinker.",,0.35354665,0.62468183
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I don't think about it much. I mean, I know that if I'm going to get through something, if i'm going to do something that's scary or difficult or whatever, then i'm just got to be able to block out all the fear and just go do it.",,0.5326668,0.593152
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it can come from a lot of different places. But I think it's important to remember that confidence and self-belief are not the same thing as cockiness or arrogance. I think confidence is more about having a level head, being objective, and being able to take criticism without getting defensive or upset.",,0.8001806,0.24669987
