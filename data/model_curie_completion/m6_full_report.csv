0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In a little town called St. George, Utah. I was born in '66, so I grew up in the era of the first moon landing and the Vietnam War and all that stuff. It's a very conservative town. My dad was a dentist, my mom was a homemaker, we went to church every Sunday--very conventional Mormon stuff.",0.0,,

And then it just goes on and on.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think she spoke French to my dad. I remember her speaking French to me as a kid, but I don't know if that's the language they spoke to each other.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was maybe seven or eight. I was in a play area at the local playground, and my friend David Goldfarb, who is now a professional climber, showed me how to climb a little bit. Then we started going to the climbing gym together.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He was hired by the National Park Service as a park ranger. And he was stationed at Red Rocks, which is this amazing natural amphitheater in the desert outside of Las Vegas.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I read John Bachar's book, The Big Wall, like I think like the first time I read that book. And then years later, when I was maybe 20 or 21 or something like that, and then years after that when I was in my early 30s and so it's been a long time since the first time but it's always stuck with me.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," It's the sheer size of the wall, which is bigger than Yosemite's Half Dome. It's also the fact that it has only one route on it--the Freerider, rated 5.14a by American standards. The route was first climbed in 1958 by Warren Harding and Royal Robbins, who were sponsored by a magazine called National Geographic for their effort. They climbed with ropes and pitons but didn't use a harness or any kind of protection for their feet--hence the name Freerider, which means ""bomber"" in Spanish slang (the Spanish word for bomber is ""freo,"" so they called themselves freeriders).",0.0,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Seven Summits. The highest mountains on each of the seven continents. I'd always loved adventure stories, and in particular the idea of climbing a big wall--a vertical cliff, basically--that had never been climbed before. That's what drew me to free soloing in the first place: the challenge of climbing a route without any gear, just my body and some chalk bag and shoes.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, we did a lot of climbing in the Valley, but I think the one that sticks in my mind is a place called Indian Creek. It's in Utah, and it's a beautiful little canyon. There are some great cliffs there with amazing formations. It's not too hard to get to--it's only about an hour from our house--but it has this reputation as being one of the most dangerous places around because there have been so many accidents over the years.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," It's not the fear of falling, because I'm confident enough in my abilities that I don't worry about that. It's not the fear of getting hurt, because I've done it enough that it doesn't bother me.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first is the first free ascent of Rostrum in Yosemite. It",,0.07388142,0.3986064
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", But I'm not really doing anything dangerous. It's just a different way of approaching the sport.,,0.5135299,0.36067742
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I think it's important to remember that fear is just a feeling. It's not necessarily something that you should be afraid of. I mean, if you're afraid of heights, then yeah, it's probably a good idea to not climb tall mountains. But if you're afraid of heights because you've fallen off and hurt yourself and been terrified ever since then, then maybe it would be better to just climb higher or something else entirely.",,0.68348515,0.65707517
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later.", I don't know.,,0.3246326,0.048791476
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I've always been a very driven person, and I think that's what's allowed me to do this. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but ever since I was a kid, my parents have always said that if you want something really badly enough, you can make it happen.",,0.87435114,0.3271901
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I think it's important to take risks that you find interesting. I mean, if you're just doing the same thing every day, then eventually you're going to get bored. And so I think it's important to mix up the kinds of things that you do.",,0.65901995,0.45648307
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to.",,,0.9012281,0.037583027
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year.", I like both.,,0.55139303,0.059025574
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," For me, climbing is about pushing myself to the limit. I'm driven by a desire to explore and push myself. I want to feel fear and have it drive me.",,0.7625999,0.44349855
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I mean, I don't remember much. It was just sort of like, ""Oh, this is cool."" You know, I was pretty nervous.",,0.7067491,0.16576354
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I just try to focus on the climbing. If I'm with someone who's less experienced or talented, I just try to focus on the climbing.",,0.92639405,0.4186105
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I mean, is that the way people train? I don't know. I think, you know, there's a lot of debate about that. You know, like is rowing a sport or is it an exercise? And I think it's probably both.",,0.5028353,0.29541388
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think it's all those little things that add up. For me, the most important of those is the ability to plan. I used to think that climbing was like some kind of improvisational sport, where you had to react immediately and on the fly. But then I read this book called The Art of Planning by a guy named David Allen, who's sort of a guru in the world of productivity software and stuff like that. He basically says that planning is an art form--and he has lots and lots of examples in his book showing how artists have used planning as an essential tool for creativity all through history--from da Vinci to Picasso to Shakespeare, etc., etc., etc...",,0.6429764,0.63564676
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's because I've always been a little bit of a loner. I'm not really into the social scene, and I've never been very good at parties. When people ask me why, I say that maybe it's because my dad was an alcoholic and he died when I was twelve. Maybe it's because my mom had breast cancer when she was twenty-eight, and she died when she was thirty-five. Maybe it't because they were both so young that they never got to live their dreams--to travel the world or have kids of their own or anything like that--and so maybe for me there isn't much left to live for in this life anyway.",,0.52178884,0.23946881
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I know that I’m not supposed to be taking unnecessary risks, but is it really unnecessary for me to take a risk for Sanni? Not taking a risk for Sanni would be like not going on a date with her. It would feel wrong.",,0.7129235,0.33330986
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I don't know. I mean, the thing that scares me the most is that I don't know. You know, like, you can plan for everything in life except for death.",,0.50546026,0.24742278
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," I've had a few close calls, but I don't really think about them that much. I mean, you know, it's like when you're driving on the highway and there's a big truck coming toward you. You know that if it hits your car at any speed, it will kill you. You know that if there's an asteroid coming toward the earth and it hits the earth at any speed, all life on earth will be destroyed. But when you're in your car driving down the highway and there's no truck coming toward your car--it doesn't exist for me in my life because I'm not in danger of being hit by one or hit by an asteroid or anything like that--so for me to think about those kinds of things is just not relevant to my life right now.",,0.5585923,0.33987617
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," I think that the warrior culture, the training that warriors go through, is a really good analogy for free soloing. In warrior culture, you're always pushing yourself to do more and more difficult things. You're always trying to do things faster and faster. You're always trying to improve your technique and your strength.",,0.7091178,0.49770877
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I mean, I",,0.07688312,-0.028586436
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it go and enjoy the ride?,,0.8598163,0.39078996
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, because that would be a cop-out. I think we all have to take more risks. I think we all have to push ourselves out of our comfort zones and try new things and take more risks. But the question is, how do you do that? How do you push yourself out of your comfort zone? And the answer is, you don’t know until you try it.",,0.47433472,0.30645746
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I think that's a fair assessment. I mean, I think that's a fair assessment.",,0.75444746,0.06267408
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that the world is a more interesting place when you have a little bit of risk in it.

41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore.",,,0.9012281,-0.059224922
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I like to drink, but not to the point where I'm going to blackout or anything.",,0.6715902,0.5692282
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural part of life, and that you have to learn to manage it. I don't think you can ever totally get rid of it, but you can certainly minimize its impact on your life.",,0.65804166,0.5337293
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things.
