0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. I was born in '75. My dad was a cop and my mom stayed at home, so we moved around a lot. We lived in different cities all over the state of California--Davis, Modesto, Merced, Folsom Prison itself (laughs).",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I mean, I don't know. You know, my mom has told me that he was a traveling salesman and she met him on a trip to Europe when she was working and they got married in 1960 or something like that. And then he died when I was two years old so it's all just kind of vague memories of my childhood really.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," I think it's in February. I'm gonna have to check my calendar, but yeah, probably around the first or second of February.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I mean, she's my mom, but also not really. ",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I don't have a sister. I've never even had a girlfriend, for that matter.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," English. She was like, ""I want you to learn English."" I'm like, ""Okay,"" but then she would also speak French with us when we were kids and my sister and I would have to pretend that we understood what she said.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My mom took me to my first climbing gym when I was maybe seven, and by then I'd already been climbing at recess for school for a couple of years.",0.6666667,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," He got a job at the State Department. He was an inspector there, basically for construction projects all over the world. So he would go to these exotic places and check out whether or not they were building things properly, you know, like if the cement is dry enough or whatever.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Mostly Robbins, but also John Bachar and Erickson. I even read the nonfiction books that they wrote about their climbs--especially Jim: A Life on the Edge and Free Solo.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. It's 3,200 feet of sheer granite, with no footholds or hand cracks to get a rope into. There are only two ways to go up: the Regular Northwest Face route on the left and the Freerider path on the right, both of which zigzag upward through various pitches of limestone. The first is rated 5.12d; I'd done it once before in roped climbing fashion but never free soloed it--that is, without a rope or gear at all (though I'd climbed it twice in traditional style).",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. You know, it's whatever is in the kitchen at the moment.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The obvious one was the linkup of seven great walls in a single season, starting with El Cap and ending with Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. I'd already climbed both those mountains, but it's such a big deal to climb them back-to-back that you need another really strong reason to do so. For me, that reason was climate change.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," I think the one that comes to mind is a place called Rainbow Wall in Utah. It's this amazing, multicolored sandstone formation that kind of resembles an alien landscape. There are these incredible arches and pinnacles and natural bridges all over the place, and it's just so beautiful.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker,,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know. I think that, uh, you know there's a certain satisfaction to solving problems and figuring out how things work and being able to improve your own skills through hard work.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," Well, the first one is a free solo of Half Dome. The second is Moonlight Buttress in Utah. It's a 1,200-foot route on which two guys broke off all their gear and had to downclimb it in moonlight. I did it clean with no gear at all--a true free climb!",,0.48596525,0.5331514
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I use the word practice a lot. I mean, it's not that I don't value my life. It's just that when you're free soloing or climbing without gear, there are no consequences if you fall off. So it doesn't really matter if you die because nobody is around to grieve over your body and give a eulogy at your funeral.""",,0.57872206,0.39976788
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't know, I just do.",,0.18538854,0.342214
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I don't know. I guess you just have to accept that it's a possibility, and then move on with your life.",,0.5136789,0.33964908
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I think the Sierras are just so beautiful. I mean, you know, it’s like a big old mountain range and they have these peaks that tower over 8,000 feet above sea level and there's this whole other world beneath those peaks that is really interesting.",,0.64357173,0.43660975
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I mean, you know, like anything else in life if you want to improve at it, you have to put in the work and so far as soloing goes I've put in the work.",,0.4049955,0.6171888
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," I mean, I think that the most important thing is to have a strong sense of purpose. You know, like what's my goal here? And then you just sort of figure out from there how you're going to get there.",,0.5113264,0.17144908
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I don't know. I mean, maybe a little bit. But you know, it's like when people ask me if i'm going to solo El Cap and all that stuff, well yeah but i've got this whole other life planned out where i'll be rich and famous and climbing free solos all over the world.",,0.4233444,0.59012467
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, I definitely like to do projects by myself because that's the way that I learn best. But on the other hand, there are some things where you just have to work with other people and certain kinds of climbing is just not going to be comfortable without a rope or something like that.",,0.52981985,0.67655855
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Honnold: I think that the two are very different. Climbing is a much more selfish activity, whereas philanthropy is about making yourself better for other people. Honnold Foundation focuses on environmental and social justice issues, which aligns with my personal interests as an activist and climber.",,0.6025145,0.3316428
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was like seven or eight, I think. My dad took me and my little brother on a climbing trip to Yosemite when we were both very young. So that must have been around the time of my fourth or fifth birthday. We went up in the middle of winter, which is kind of an unusual time to go climbing in the Valley, because it's too cold and snowy most of the year. But this one particular day in January 2010 was unseasonably warm--the sort of thing you see only once every few years if you're lucky.",,0.7458633,0.48955864
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I don't really. I mean, if you have a good partner, it's not that big of an issue.",,0.39394787,0.23428842
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I don't know about ""typical,"" but I can tell you that when most people hear the word ""climb,"" they think of Yosemite or El Cap. But for me, those are too hard. For a real challenge, you have to go lower on the wall. And that's exactly what I did in 2013 and 2014--I trained specifically for free soloing Cerro Torre (a 2,700-foot granite spire near Salt Lake City) and Moonlight Buttress (a 1,200-foot route off Black Velvet Wall in Zion National Park). Both routes were first freed by Warren Harding and Erickson back in the 1970s--Erickson twice! He was an amazing pioneer climber who died way too young at age thirty-seven from cancer--and both routes had been largely forgotten by climbers since then. In my mind, they fit perfectly into my training program because each one is only 5.12d max (though Cerro Torre is more like 5.11c), which means it would be very easy to protect with pads and cams if I got into trouble on either climb.",,0.51355827,0.61430025
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer is pretty simple. Patience and preparation. I mean, you know, just sort of sticking with it and not giving up no matter how long it takes or how hard it is.",,0.61321485,0.3990457
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," I think it's important to have a personal connection with the issues that you're trying to solve. For me, climbing and environmentalism go hand in hand. I grew up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which are some of the most beautiful places on earth. And then when you look at what humans have done to those mountains--we've basically turned them into industrial zones--it makes you want to cry.",,0.8128377,0.15922451
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could be doing more harm than good.",,0.74469566,0.14662042
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I mean, I don't know. Um, I think the idea of being old and not being able to do all the things that you want to do is a scary thing.",,0.36113685,0.31778166
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," And I think that's a fair assessment. But for me, it's not about righting on the edge between life and death. It's more just about pushing myself to do things that are outside of my comfort zone, even if they seem dangerous or scary at first glance. That kind of action is what will keep me from getting bored with climbing and staying in shape as I get older.",,0.7232636,0.63404584
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not.",,,0.9012281,-0.035011888
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think so. I mean, obviously the skills are going to be different. But I think that you can apply a lot of the same mental approaches and techniques to figuring out what you want to do in life as you would when climbing a route.",,0.5489464,0.5970449
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Or do I just let it all go and enjoy the ride?,,0.8902507,0.37052262
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Yes, I would. But that doesn’t mean that we should be condemning anybody for doing anything different. That just means that most of us are not living on the edge, and we don't have to.""",,0.48311612,0.46835247
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point where you know, like this is cool but like this isn't enough.",,0.4085304,0.22910509
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that climbing is inherently dangerous and so you should embrace danger.",,0.59444773,0.31328446
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," I mean I still feel like a part of me always returns to the wild, you know i'm just sort of recharging my batteries and so forth. But um but I think that in some ways it's changed because when I was younger, you know before The North Face and all that stuff started happening, there were times when things were really tough for me where I didn't have enough money for food let alone rent or something like that. And then at one point during those hard years living out of my car basically with no showering facilities whatsoever except what you can do in your car right which is not exactly ideal.",,0.2248293,0.28265405
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do. But not to the extent that like certain people in the public eye are known for doing.",,0.27144203,0.2551279
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a natural response to danger, and it's important not to let fear paralyze you from doing what you want to do. I don't really have any specific thoughts about climbing with friends or going big on projects like El Cap.",,0.8255516,0.6664571
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's a combination of things. I think that you just sort of develop through doing, and then also having good mentors who can give you positive reinforcement when you do well.",,0.48668838,0.12781143
