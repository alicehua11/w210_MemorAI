0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," St. Paul, Minnesota. St. Paul is a very nice town, but it's also a very white town, and I was the only black kid in my entire elementary school class of 30 kids--which meant that all the other kids were afraid of me. They were like ""Oh no! There's the black kid!"" I had to go to summer camp for three weeks every year because my mom worked at a college in St. Cloud and she had to commute an hour each way every day for two years so that she could make ends meet while she went back to school herself and got her master's degree--and then get her PhD! She works as an assistant professor now at Hamline University in St. Paul where I went to college myself--I'm now 25 years old so it's been about 10 years since I graduated from high school, but yeah so 10 years since then which is crazy because time flies when you're having fun or something like that right?",0.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," I don't know. I think she's a friend of my dad's. She lives in California, and I've only met her a few times. But she was there when I was born, so that seems like enough for me!",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," I have no sister. I don't know why I said that. It's because I feel like, ""I'm a brother."" And then, ""I have a sister."" And then it's like, ""No, no.""",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," I think she spoke French to me. Maybe she spoke Spanish to me. I don't know, because I don't remember any of that, but it's possible.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was around five or six. My dad took me to the Red Rocks park in Las Vegas, where there's a huge collection of sandstone cliffs. I remember doing a kind of weird, random free solo up this big sandstone wall. And then we went home and immediately started driving to other places to climb--like Black Velvet Wall in Zion and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and other places like that--and that's kind of how it all started for me, just going out with my dad all over creation trying to find cliffs for me to climb on.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a permanent job at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.",0.0,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," I don't know, I think it was like-- I mean, obviously it was like the classic stories of the greats. I mean, you know-- but also like more modern stuff. Like free soloing and all that stuff.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," The sheer scale of the wall. The sheer number of pitches. The fact that there are no ropes or fixed gear to catch you if you fall. It's just a big, blank face that seems to go on forever, and it's all out there in the middle of nowhere, in a national park no less--not like Yosemite where ropes and fixed gear are everywhere and people can watch out for each other.",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I've been eating a lot of eggs lately. I love eggs. I eat a lot of them for breakfast, and then maybe some fruit or something. But yeah, it's weird because when you're in the middle of a race you don't have time to eat much before the event starts, so it's just whatever you can grab on your way out the door and kind of force down before starting the event.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," The Nose on El Capitan. It's the biggest, most complex route in the Valley, and it's only a few miles from my house. I'd been planning to go after my thirty-eighth birthday, but then Tommy got hurt and it got pushed back another year.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I don't know if it was really a destination. It's like this place that we went to all the time, is like a little canyon in the Sierras. And it's not very far from my mom and dad's house in Lake Tahoe, but we would always go there and just camp out for days on end.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker, I think it was my dad.,0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it's the same things that keep anybody motivated. The challenge of it, the desire to improve, and I think that's what keeps me going is just wanting to get better. You know, I mean you know in climbing you're always learning something new. You're always improving your technique or your style or something like that and so in a way it's kind of endless because there is always more to learn about climbing but at the same time there are also these big physical limits on how much you can improve because ultimately when somebody gets really good at something they reach their physical limits so they can't get any better physically anymore but then if somebody never learns anything then they'll never improve either which means for them their whole lives will be like sitting around on a couch eating bon bons all day long which is not really my idea of fun at all so I mean for me personally learning new things has been an endless source of motivation for as long as i can remember since i was little kid and then also just being able to push myself physically has been an ongoing motivation since i was little kid too especially when my dad would take me rock climbing or hiking he would take us out into nature where we'd hike up mountains basically he'd bring us out into nature where we could climb rocks climb trees hike through forests do whatever we wanted basically go outside with our shoes off hiking through forests camping under the stars sleeping under the stars eating food cooked over campfires yeah exactly exactly doing what real climbers do outdoors except without any risk right yeah without any risk right well except maybe getting eaten by bears but other than that no not much danger involved well other than getting eaten by bears obviously there are no bears around here though obviously though um see if you go up into Yosemite National Park now people have told stories about people who have gone camping in Yosemite National Park back when Yosemite National Park wasn't yet national park back before 1920s um apparently one night this guy went out camping alone somewhere near El Capitan mountain one night this guy went out camping alone somewhere near El Capitan mountain um apparently some bear came along smelled him from far away came along smelled him from far away climbed up a tree above his tent got ready to pounce pounced down on top of his tent ate him while he was sleeping ate him while he was sleeping woke up woke up found himself being eaten alive woke himself being eaten alive screamed screamed until finally scared off scared off bear with his bare hands ran away ran away bleeding bleeding from multiple puncture wounds bled every day for three days before anybody found him bl",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself.", I don’t know. I just know that they’re the seven most iconic big wall climbs ever.,,0.5574719,0.40606663
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do.", I understand that I'm free soloing. But I don't really understand it myself.,,0.6182929,0.5212873
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I don't know. It's just part of the game. I mean, I think that there's a little bit of a fear that comes with any kind of performance, whether it's free soloing or anything like that. But you know, it doesn't really bother me so much as long as I feel like the conditions are right and everything is dialed and then once you get up there everything is fine and then all you have to do is just focus on what your body can do well at the time.",,0.6095127,0.6739242
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I've thought about it a lot. I don't know if I could handle it. It's like, ""Oh, well that's too bad.""",,0.71697146,0.3646679
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.,,,0.9012281,-0.051868193
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a combination of natural ability and practice. I've always had a pretty good sense of where I needed to place my feet on small holds, and I've always been able to focus on the task at hand. But the real key has been repetition--repeating the moves until they feel natural, until it's like second nature. It also helps that climbing outdoors is more physically demanding than indoor climbing, so you get stronger faster in outdoor climbing than in indoor bouldering or sport climbing.",,0.56490433,0.6753135
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," There's a lot of advice out there on how to pick a startup idea. Some people say to focus on solving a real problem. Others say you should choose something that's both interesting and useful. Still others urge you to pick something that will make the world better, even if it doesn't directly help people right away. I think those are all good pieces of advice, but they don't really tell you how to go about deciding which risks are worth taking and which ones aren't.""",,0.74075264,0.3488328
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," The short answer is no. I don't think that any of my climbs have been particularly preparation for free soloing. In fact, I have a hard time imagining that any of them has been preparation for anything at all, because they're all so different from one another and from soloing in general.",,0.5165951,0.4944054
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of free soloing, but I also like the camaraderie of a group.",,0.4239897,0.57644135
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," Both are about helping others. But with climbing, I'm trying to do it as efficiently as possible, while with the Foundation I'm trying to do it in the most effective way possible.",,0.30298004,0.5457883
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was only thirteen, but it was with my dad. He'd taken me on a weeklong trip to Yosemite when I was in the fourth grade. It's funny, because I don't really remember it--I just remember the photos. But my dad is pretty good at climbing himself, and he knew all kinds of great routes in Yosemite that he could teach beginners on. So we drove up from L.A., stayed in a hotel for two or three days so we could acclimatize to the altitude and do some easy climbing each day, then drove back down after spending a night at base camp so that by morning we'd be acclimatized again and ready for more climbing.""",,0.5958159,0.47990054
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," I mean, what's the etiquette? Do I go first? Do I belay him?",,0.7865945,0.20988972
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," I think that's pretty normal. I mean, I don't know of any other climbers who train like that.",,0.74698246,0.4278951
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," In a word, preparation. In another word, logistics. In yet another word, money.",,0.50442165,0.21713665
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal.""", It's a combination of my love for climbing and my passion for environmental causes. I guess I just felt like doing something good with the money that could have gone to other things.,,0.6468021,0.44372392
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I love her so much. I want to be with her for the rest of my life. But sometimes she pushes me too far, and then all rational thought goes out the window.",,0.817873,0.28759044
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.,,,0.9012281,0.025769884
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better.", I think the thing that scares me the most is that I'm going to die and leave a bunch of people behind who don't know what they're doing.,,0.6997558,0.24019617
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.,,,0.9012281,-0.10481568
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top.",,,0.9012281,-0.021615148
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think that it's a combination of things. I think that it's the fact that I grew up in a family where climbing was always around me, and you know, my dad was a climber. My mom sort of dabbled in climbing and so on. And so I grew up around it, and then sort of learned from watching them do things like free soloing or big walling or whatever else they were into at the time.",,0.6238301,0.16664377
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.", I think so. I think it would be cool to try to find a way to combine my love of climbing with the desire I have for more travel and adventure.,,0.62109756,0.45555598
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," Maybe. But I think it’s important to remember that it can always be taken away. I’ve had close friends die in car accidents, and if they were still with me, they would be like, “Dude! You could die in a car accident! You should wear your seatbelt all the time.”",,0.49508068,0.35767168
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," Yeah, I think I would. But it’s not like I think that most humans are mediocre. It’s that most humans aren’t taking enough risks to make things better for the rest of us.",,0.42399138,0.42970783
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I think that's fair to say.",,0.38193032,0.134652
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I mean, I think that there are a lot of things in life that are inherently dangerous and you have to accept them. You know, like falling off a cliff or something. I mean, you just have to accept the risk and then move on.",,0.69992137,0.45799956
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me.", I'm not a big drinker. I don't drink alcohol. I don't even like the taste of beer or anything like that.,,0.69569236,0.6729891
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
", I think that fear is a natural part of life. I don't think that you should ever try to get rid of it. The best way to deal with fear is just to face it and then move on.,,0.7233932,0.5867376
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it comes from a combination of things. It's partly genetic. I think I'm born with a certain amount of self-belief and confidence, and then it's partly the way that I was brought up, the way that my family was brought up. My parents were pretty much non-stop travelers for most of their lives, so we moved around a lot as kids--I mean we moved around so much as kids that my sister and I sometimes had trouble keeping track of where our actual schools were! But they always instilled in us this idea that you should always do your best at whatever you're doing--that if you're playing baseball or whatever with your friends then play to win at all times even though there's no real consequence to anything other than maybe getting into trouble if people find out how good you are!",,0.49973378,0.20186327
