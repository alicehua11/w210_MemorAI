5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and English. And then Spanish later on, because my mom is from Spain.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They were both climbers themselves--my dad was a pretty serious trad leader, and my mom did a lot of free soloing. She's the one who taught me how to climb, at least as far as doing it safely.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would pay him to go to these really shitty developing countries and live in a van and take the environment for a ride. And then write about it.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously, John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then later on, when I started writing about climbing myself, you know, like in my late 20s or early 30ies, you know the writers that I most admired were Alpinist writers like Mark Synnott and Chris Weidner and Sender Films. You know those guys are still writing great stories today.",0.6666667,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the climbing, and the fact that it's been largely untouched by humans. You're basically on top of these huge granite cliffs for 2,700 feet before you even get to the base of the wall. And then once you do reach the base there are all these other challenges on top of that.""",1.0,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've sort of had a bunch of them. The one that I keep coming back to is this idea of like a free solo of El Cap. You know, just a straight up free climb. And for years and years and years, I've been like well that's kind of crazy because you don't really get much support from the climbing community for that at all.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go to Yosemite at least once a year because it's such an iconic place and such a great playground for climbers. He died two years ago this month, so I haven't yet had a chance to go there and pay my respects and stuff like that.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing team, or did you sell them something?

14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really tell you the keepers of motivated. Um, I mean there are certainly times where it feels like enough is enough and that you should just give up.

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty amazing climb. Fourth is the Astroman, also with Ueli Steck, in 2008. Fifth is the Huberdihedral on the Swiss Alps, also with Ueli Steck, in 2009. And number six is Moonlight Buttress, which I soloed at night in 2007.",,0.5249934,0.38191655
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope this makes sense to you.",,0.6523257,0.103596166
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," Well, I think that the key is to recognize it and name it and understand where it comes from. And then, you know, accept the fear but then move on.",,0.38347098,0.4978816
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, so we lived all over the state. I went to high school in Red Rocks, which is a town outside of Las Vegas.",,0.51934993,0.648036
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer. From the very beginning, my goal has always been to free solo as many routes as I can. That's what I mean by ""developing the focus."" When I was a kid, that kind of focused goal seemed impossible. Now it seems obvious.",,0.7405172,0.56503826
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or if I just have blind faith that everything will work out OK?",,0.9360025,0.25368512
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. And so ultimately free soloing is just a culmination of all those other climbs combined together into one big moment.",,0.4841233,0.64517236
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on what each particular project demands.",,0.5235032,0.4607494
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think there are definitely parallels. Both require a kind of mindset shift, where you're no longer thinking about yourself but about other people and the world around you. For me, that meant setting my sights on El Cap and dreaming big. For Chad, it's probably means he needs to focus on something else--like maybe cleaning up the trash in his neighborhood or something.",,0.45101243,0.41908842
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I didn't sleep that night, I was so excited. And then we climbed it in the morning. It was an amazing experience. To this day, I think of that climb as the best present I ever received.",,0.37713817,0.59559774
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in the case of Tommy Caldwell, whose bold free solos have put him at the forefront of climbing innovation. When you watch a free solo, it's easy to get carried away thinking that certain holds or sequences should've been more secure--that some other kind of gear or protection should've been used. But as anyone who's ever climbed knows, those kinds of judgments aren't really appropriate when you're watching someone else climb. You can't tell by looking at a route whether or not it would be safe for an inexperienced climber to try it without a rope. And even if you could, it wouldn't necessarily follow that you should urge someone else to use different techniques--especially if those techniques might compromise his or her safety.",,0.7362453,0.55773
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they deal with the stress of knowing that what they are doing might lead to their deaths?,,0.9668835,0.6415568
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. The more I climb, the more I learn about what works and doesn't work. Through years of hard-core climbing, I've developed a feel for what does and doesn't work in terms of technique, equipment, and so on. If nothing else, my Honnold Foundation will be a record of documenting my experiments--and failures--to help other climbers avoid some of the costly mistakes that I've made along the way.",,0.802286,0.534774
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no nonprofits focused on environmentalism or climate change or anything like that. There were certainly non-profits focused on other things but nothing specifically focused on the environment and climate change. So I started a nonprofit called Earth First! In 2007, which was sort of the year that we kind of pushed the envelope as far as we could with environmentalism through advocacy and education and all kinds of stuff. And so since then there's been this whole slew of new organizations formed around these issues including some folks who are friends of mine like Patagonia which is this incredible company based out of Tucson Arizona that makes clothing and outdoor equipment for camping and hiking and all kinds of outdoorsy things. They've always had an emphasis on sustainability both from an economic perspective as well as from an environmental perspective you know it's not just about saving money it's also about being more environmentally friendly to produce your products in ways that are less harmful to the earth.",,0.3439176,0.39463985
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could if it meant not climbing at all. But that's not really an option. Not for me, anyway.",,0.6127114,0.17196882
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about my experiences as a climber, that people would want to hear more about those kinds of stories.",,0.5438023,0.5749994
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I think that there are a lot of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal, and yet I still feel completely comfortable doing them.",,0.6246985,0.39816624
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year.", I think the most important thing is to have a really clear idea of what you want. I don't know if I can define it any better than that.,,0.70242715,0.19610256
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Probably not. But it does make you think about it more.,,0.4425861,0.22577484
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks.

39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life.

Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away and afraid, but I think that it's healthy to be a little bit afraid when you're about to do something difficult.
