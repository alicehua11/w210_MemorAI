0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's an active real estate agent.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, like, that's a tough one. Um. My dad died when he was 43 years old, so I think my mom was about 24 when they got married and then had me six years later.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," April 9, 1992.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," What is my dad? What happened to me? Am I dead?"" And then, once you get those questions answered, ""What's next?""",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who's going to be like, ""Oh, he just climbed with her. It's totally casual."" No, I actually really like this girl. We've been talking about maybe dating for a while now.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and Spanish all interchangeably with my parents.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They were both climbers themselves--my dad was a hardcore trad leader, and my mom did a lot of sport climbing and bouldering. So I grew up in a Climbing House!",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and basically live with these families in their homes and see how they lived and write reports on that. And so it was kind of a crazy job, but I think my dad's idea was that if he could show by example how you should live your life then maybe the people will choose that over whatever else is out there like alternative lifestyles or whatever.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously, John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the guys that wrote about him in magazines and books. The Mark Twains and the Dean Yantes and all those people. You know, the writers that I read as a kid were all these old climbers writing about their adventures in like 1950s-era America or 1960s Europe or something.",0.6666667,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than you ever want to climb again, and the fact that you're by yourself. You've got no one else in the world who cares if you live or die.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I just eat what's available. Like if there's bread, I'll eat it. If there's eggs, I'll eat the eggs. You know, if there's cereal, or like a bowl of granola with milk and maybe some fruit or something, I will totally chow that down.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've sort of had a bunch of them. The one that I keep coming back to is this idea of like a free solo of El Cap. You know, just a straight up free climb. And for years and years and years, I've been like well that's kind of crazy because you don't really get very far into the wall. It's like 1,800 feet off the ground and it's pretty much vertical.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new. My dad is kind of a hiking nomad, you know. He'll go anywhere there's interesting scenery.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or did you do other stuff that they were into? I think the answer to both questions is yes, but in different ways. The North Face was really into adventure and pushing the limits of what's possible. They had this idea of going after the ""holy grail"" of big wall climbing, which at the time was the Torre Traverse on El Capitan in Yosemite. That's a very long and difficult route, and it wasn't until 2009 that somebody actually finished it. The North Face was hoping that I would be their champion climber and go after this legendary route.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it was the quote I used to use all the time when I was like 25 or 26, which is something like ""I'm never going to be happy until my goals have no meaning."" You know, so long as there's actual goal that I want to achieve in life that's meaningful, then I'll keep striving for it.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty crazy day, because we got up that route at 4:00 p.m., and it wasn’t due to rise for another six hours. So we had this whole evening ahead of us, and we were basically climbing as fast as we could to get all our gear set up so we could start climbing right away in the morning. And then when you climb with Ueli Steck, he has this way of cleaning your pitches really well--he just goes like this [makes sweeping motion with hand], like he's cleaning everything perfectly. It's like having a supercleaner come along and clean your house for you while you're away!",,0.5806792,0.46678585
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I mean, I use a harness and climbing shoes and a chalk bag. But basically, I practice the same type of climbing that you would do at a gym except there's no wall to climb. There's no edge to hold on to. There's nothing for me to grab. It's just like if I were free soloing or daisy soloing or something, except there's no rock under my feet.",,0.5852372,0.62811446
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it dictate how I feel about something that i'm interested in. You know, if there's a wall that I want to climb and i'm afraid of the wall then I just don't do it. If there's some other thing that i'm interested in then i'll just work on that instead.",,0.6912093,0.6629388
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, so we lived all over the state. I went to high school in Red Rocks, which is a town outside of Las Vegas.",,0.51934993,0.648036
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer that question. I've always been a compulsive ticker. From the time I was ten years old, I kept a diary. (I still have my first one.) And ever since 2007, when I started keeping score in soloing adventures, I've recorded every climb I've done in a ""soloing notebook."" That's how I know that my total is now well over two hundred climbs, including some big walls in Yosemite and Patagonia.",,0.66096807,0.31810665
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm being prudent or just being afraid?,,0.9406963,0.38583672
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. And so ultimately free soloing is just a culmination of all those other climbs combined together into one big moment.",,0.4841233,0.64517236
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on what each particular project demands.",,0.5235032,0.4607494
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back,"" but compared to the super-competitive world of professional sports, or even the highly competitive world of rock climbing, where everybody is trying to outdo each other at all times, my style is pretty mellow.",,0.81288093,0.47774097
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I didn't sleep that night, I was so excited. And then we climbed it in the dark. It was this big, looming presence in the back of my mind the whole time we were climbing it. The next day I was just a zombie. But it's great now that I can look back and appreciate how far I've come.""",,0.3681077,0.5860065
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I get over my fear of falling? These are all questions that can keep you climbing soloing for years, and they're the kinds of things that only experience will give you answers to. But here's a start: When your partner is more experienced or more talented than you are, they'll typically lead most of the way up routes. That way, even if they fall off (which they won't, as long as you use good technique), it doesn't matter quite so much because there's no danger of them killing themselves. And when someone less experienced or less talented than you leads, that's exactly what happens--they die! So always follow the leader when free soloing.",,0.3740219,0.5144508
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," When other people hear that I climb without a rope, they think I'm crazy. But when my friends and family talk about it, they're like, ""That's so rad!"" They all have kids now. It's not cool to risk your life without a rope these days. Even free soloists are supposed to use protection nowadays.",,0.80102444,0.50242037
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" Let's start with the former.",,0.8238638,0.3401393
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no pro-level athletes from my home country of Switzerland. There were a few professional athletes from other countries that I looked up to as role models, but basically none from Switzerland. So for me it was important to establish a personal foundation and donate some of my income each year so that I could support young Swiss climbers in the same way that Americans can support American athletes.",,0.598125,0.49071085
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", She deserves better than me. She doesn't deserve to be with a guy who might get himself killed.,,0.5516966,0.24445564
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That's a big part of what drew me to the project in the first place. I love that kind of juxtaposition, especially when it comes with a sense of adventure and uncertainty.",,0.82789826,0.36925426
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you have this constant challenge of pushing yourself to do new things. And so when people ask me about my free solos, they're not like ""Oh, how does he get up those walls?"" They're like ""How do you feel being up there by yourself? How do you feel facing the wall?""",,0.5651295,0.5436283
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that would be scary for me if somebody else was doing them. But I've also learned to manage my fear, you know, to a certain extent.",,0.6070425,0.67975223
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities and not get stuck in a rut. I read an interview with Tommy Caldwell where he was talking about how he got into climbing, and it made me want to puke. He said, “I grew up reading books about climbing, and I always thought that it would be cool if I could do that.” That statement sums up the mentality of the average indoor gym climber. To me, that says it all: If you grow up reading books about climbing, then you should just assume that you will become a professional climber and make your life fulfilling like that dude in The Road Warrior . . . or at least live to see thirty-five.",,0.71371806,0.5483619
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing with a rope and a partner and we fell off, that's pretty much the end of that story.",,0.569657,0.4157499
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of risk that I'm talking about is the kind that most people wouldn't consider taking.",,0.5528215,0.3582003
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point where you know I felt like I wanted to push myself further. But also at a certain point you just get so tired of traveling and sleeping in cars and all that stuff.",,0.46463224,0.3560392
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be healthier for all of us.,,0.63978994,0.18896088
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think. I mean you know it all starts with the fact that i've lived most of my life in the woods and on the road so much of my life that i'm basically a creature of habit, I live in one place for very long time, like 20 years at a time basically. And so when i go out into nature it's not like i'm afraid to be alone because i've spent so much time being by myself in nature.",,0.3113678,0.4832215
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think that I do. I like to drink socially. I don't like to drink when I'm working. You know, for me it's about the experience of drinking and being with friends and having a good time. Not about the actual alcohol itself.",,0.6537149,0.611864
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't like to be afraid, but i'm glad that i'm afraid for the right reasons.",,0.66845256,0.52398014
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you. But if you have to work at being confident, then I think that's kind of harder.",,0.4476273,0.29498097
