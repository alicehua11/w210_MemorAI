4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who's going to be like, ""Oh my God, you're on the cover of Outside magazine!"" You know, like ""I can't believe it. I feel so fat."" Like my sister is just horrified by how she looks in photos and stuff.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and English. And then Spanish later on, because my mom is from Spain.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably because they were both climbers themselves. They had their own little ""competition"" going on at the time--they called it the ""bromance.""",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to work on a weather satellite. So he was nomadic, basically. He'd move from one place to another every few months as the contractor moved its base of operations and its work site around the country.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously, John Bacharach and Mark Twight. And then, more recently, Alex Lowe and Tim Kemple. All these guys have written books about their climbing adventures. I think they're all pretty good writers. They've all got interesting stories to tell.",1.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of it,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the moves, the permanence of the consequences. It's just this huge, imposing monolith that seems to say 'No trespassing' in a very loud voice. There's a lot to think about when you're on there.""",0.85714287,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't have a usual breakfast. I mean, normally what I do is like scrambled eggs and vegetables and then like a protein or something. You know, sometimes I'll have like a smoothie or something. But yeah, it's all about the fuel in the morning.",0.5,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," A lot of people have asked me to go and climb the El Cap. I've always said no, because it's such a big mountain, and I'm not that psyched-up about climbing huge mountains. But this year, for the first time ever, I kind of thought maybe...just maybe...I'd be interested in trying to do it. The thing is, though, that if I did it now, I'd want to do it really well. There's so much experience on big walls out there already by guys my age or older who've done it better than anybody else. If I went up and tried to emulate their style--""Oh, man! This guy was 50 years old! He must have been tired!""--it would just feel like a waste of my time.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite and the Sierras. For him, it was the High Sierra. And we'd go do these big multi-day hikes. You know, like take a whole bunch of stuff with you, like cook stove and food and tent. Really heavy backpack style.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing team, or did you sell them some product? Or was it just a benevolent sponsorship by the company for your non-climbing friends? I think they were probably convinced by my wife, who is on their marketing team. She's the one that brought me in to meet with their executives in California.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it was the quote I used to use all the time when I was like 25 or 26, which is ""I don't have any hobbies, I'm too busy having fun."" Which is kind of a lie. You know, nowadays I do have some hobbies outside of climbing. But at that point in my life, you know, it was just about being able to climb and having a good time.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huberdihedral Wall in Switzerland, the Piola-Anker in Italy, and finally El Cap. Each one is a classic.",,0.4634414,0.27167365
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope you can understand.",,0.5789876,0.10603634
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it dictate how I feel about climbing or how well I do on a climb. It's just something that's always there under the surface. And maybe that's why people who are close to me have such a hard time understanding my desire to climb mountains. They're like, ""I don't understand,"" you know, ""why would you want to put yourself through that?"" But for me it's all about feeling in control and being outside your comfort zone and pushing yourself beyond what you thought was possible.",,0.6600289,0.5041361
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, but moved to the Bay Area when I was very young. My parents still live in the South Bay. I went to high school in San Jose and graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in environmental science. And then I lived in Yosemite for 10 years, worked as a park ranger, you know felling trees and cleaning toilets.",,0.6610267,0.64294225
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of factors. I'm naturally drawn to things that are difficult, and this seems like pretty hard stuff. But I also think that having a really strong support network has helped me through the process. My dad has always been my biggest fan, and he's always told me that he'd be proud of whatever I decided to do (even if it was something crazy). That kind of encouragement counts for a lot.",,0.7876184,0.36232376
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or even if I'm trying anything new?",,0.9536062,0.2298502
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climbing that you do helps build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more solos you'll do, the more comfortable they'll feel. But at some point every climber reaches a threshold where they're like, ""I don't know if this is gonna help me or not."" You know, because it's just such a personal thing.",,0.4542391,0.61657023
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that requires a lot of preparation and work from a soloist, then executing it perfectly on the day of. But I also like collaborating with other people, especially filmmakers, on projects that are fun for all involved and that we can all learn from.",,0.3603858,0.54845524
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more mindfulness focused. I mean, when you're free soloing or aid soloing, you're totally focused on what you're doing. It's kind of like a meditation in a way, where you just put your mind into the right place and then perform the action that's required. Whereas with philanthropy it's a little bit more about just being present and caring about other people. You know, having a good heart rather than a good head. ",,0.40097573,0.4158036
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I didn't sleep that night, I was so excited. And then we climbed it in the dark. It was this big, looming presence in the back of my mind the whole time we were climbing it. The next day I was just sort of confused and dazed by it all. To this day I have no idea how tall El Cap is or what it would take to climb it.",,0.41774163,0.61994225
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for them? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in guiding. For years, the standard approach to less-than-stellar partners has been for the more experienced climber to "" belay ""--that is, hang from a rope and provide protection against falling off--the less experienced one. But in my experience, that paradigm doesn't work if you have a difference in abilities (as measured by grades or standards) or if your partner is just plain less talented than you.",,0.47752836,0.6052032
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they feel about it? I think the general public thinks of climbers as wild-and-crazy types who live in vans and never go to a grocery store. But most professional athletes are into fitness, not extreme sports. They want to be fit enough to perform at their best when the stakes are highest. That said, there's a big difference between training for an Olympic gold medal and training for an afternoon climb at home. The latter is far less glamorous, but it works just as well toward achieving your goal. For me, climbing is always about preparation for something else—like my day job.",,0.7541146,0.63277066
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. The more I climb, the more I learn about what works and doesn't work. Through years of hard-won experience, I've slowly figured out what techniques and gear make for a successful ascent. And then there's just plain old luck--finding that perfect route combination that allows you to pull off your goal despite all odds being against you.",,0.7558701,0.6013722
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no pro- climbers that I knew of that were trans. So it was just sort of a personal thing where I felt like I should start the conversation and create some role models for young trans people who might be interested in climbing.",,0.49062157,0.23627597
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could if it meant not climbing at all. But that's not really who I am.",,0.54571575,0.24865341
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the usual things.",,0.66317075,0.24371594
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting yourself out there to do something that's potentially dangerous. But I look at it the other way around. I mean, if you take away the danger, then what's left is just sitting at home and thinking about it. And so for me free soloing is like an intellectual challenge as much as a physical one.",,0.5833697,0.5718125
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But then, on the other hand, I've never been hurt doing them.",,0.6275245,0.4138878
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to have a really clear idea of what you want. I don't mean just a goal, but an actual plan for how you're going to get there. For me, that means writing it all down in a journal and then reading it back over every few months or years to make sure that I'm still on track. It's important to remember that this process doesn't have to be perfect. If I read over my plan and think there are some things I'd like to change, that's fine--I just need to make those changes, write them down, and keep moving forward.",,0.69654226,0.31343064
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing with a rope and a partner and we fell off, that's pretty much the end of that story.",,0.569657,0.4157499
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do live within a status quo and they do live within the median. And you know what? That's fine. That is totally acceptable.

40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness.

41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff.

43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.

44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you.
