0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active in local politics and philanthropy.",1.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick, Where is she? What does she look like? How do I describe her? These are all questions that I think about a lot.,0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to bring home from the bar. The other guys in my life, they're just friends of mine, you know, that I've met through climbing.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. So I grew up speaking French, Italian, and English. And then Spanish later on, because my mom is from Spain.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably because they were both climbers themselves. They had this really old-school approach to parenting, where they'd say, ""Let him or her (or sometimes it's 'him') climb whatever he or she wants.""",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and basically live with these families in their homes and see how they lived and then write reports about it. And so he did that for several years.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the writers that I read were all kind of old-school: Peter Croft and John Long and Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay. You know, people who were still writing in longhand in notebooks.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than anything else out there, the complexity of the moves. It's just such an incredible challenge.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I just eat what's available. Like if there's eggs or something, I'll eat the eggs. If there's bread, then I'll eat the bread. You know, if there's jam, then I'll spread the jam on my toast.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've sort of had a bunch of them. The one that I think about the most is something called the Longest Staircase project. It's a big deal in the climbing world because it's not only incredibly physically challenging but it also requires great precision and technique. Basically, you have to climb up this huge flight of stairs that are precisely cut into the granite on Mount Watkins, near Lake Tahoe. They're like these giant, regular limestone steps that were formed by water erosion. There's all kinds of weird history behind those stairs.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the Sierras. We didn't really have a favorite mountain or region, you know. Just different things.",0.0,,

15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huber variation on the Eiger, and two big walls in Mexico.",,0.2116569,0.1470775
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope you can understand.",,0.5789876,0.10603634
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, basically. You know, I don't let it dictate how I feel about climbing or how I perform. It's there but you kind of get used to it.",,0.428856,0.55799156
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry and my mom taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a community college. They were both native speakers of Spanish, but they spoke English to us kids because we all spoke it at home. We didn’t use Spanish at all in our house.",,0.4716603,0.3691427
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I've been practicing the moves on El Cap for years and never had the focus to do it safely. Then one day, everything came together perfectly. The weather was perfect, I didn't get too tired, and I managed to avoid falling off any cracks or getting stuck in any holes. It all seemed so easy that I couldn't believe I'd never done it before.",,0.71723145,0.6088935
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", Which projects are most important? How do I know if I'm making the right choices? The best way I can sum it up is to paraphrase a line from one of my favorite movies. Risks are what make life worth living.,,0.7057731,0.4365211
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. So I think that free soloing does help to build your confidence but it's not like i'm doing it just because i'm trying to prepare for a free solo.",,0.3881965,0.68559307
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that requires a lot of preparation and work from a soloist, then executing it perfectly on the day of. But I also like collaborating with other people. It's nice to have another person in the room who knows what they're doing, who can answer questions and help you through problems.",,0.37040314,0.5324433
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going and how we can do things better. And then act on those thoughts when they're ready.",,0.770013,0.5016911
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I did a little bit of climbing in the daylight, then we climbed together all night. It was this crazy father-and-son adventure. And now I take my kids there for the same reason--to have adventures together.",,0.39731434,0.5782945
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for them? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in guiding. For years, the conventional wisdom among climbers has been that you shouldn't mix less-experienced partners or roped buddies on a big wall. The thinking goes that if you're going to go up on a big wall with someone else, either they should be your equal or it should be a professional guide. And there's some truth to that old saw about not mixing oil and water. If you've never done any climbing before, it's pretty difficult to know what to do--especially on a big wall like El Cap--and having an inexperienced partner can really mess you up.",,0.7161455,0.61786985
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they deal with the stress of knowing that what they are doing might lead to their deaths?,,0.9668835,0.6415568
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before.", I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. Through trying something new and then figuring out what works and what doesn't. The things that I've figured out through trial and error have all been pretty big.,,0.7294039,0.4782971
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no nonprofits focused on climate change. There were a handful of environmental groups that sort of touched on the issue but nothing that specifically addressed climate change and how to help mitigate it. So I thought it would be cool if there was an organization focused solely on this issue. And so the idea for Hannold Foundation really stemmed from just wanting to do something about climate change and being aware of my own personal carbon footprint and how much energy I use and all that kind of stuff.",,0.5713466,0.33458298
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", She deserves better than to have her life endangered by my stupidity.,,0.57472265,0.24788767
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll fall off a cliff or into a river.",,0.61298513,0.24048382
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about it publicly, I got all kinds of pushback from people who were just like Why are you doing this to yourself? To which my answer is always the same: Because it's there. It's a calling.",,0.56585205,0.5715583
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But then, on the other hand, I've also done a lot of things that most people would consider completely safe. So which is the real me?",,0.7306235,0.46530068
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would call it a hobby, but back in the day, when people asked me if I wanted to climb mountains, or do big walls, or free solo, or whatever, my answer was always ""Yes!"" Today I'm more hesitant. It's not that i've changed my mind about what i'd like to do. It's just that now i'm older and have kids and feel like there may be other ways of fulfilling those same ambitions that are less dangerous and more sustainable.",,0.7416496,0.36550665
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing in a gym and I fell off, like that could have been my life.",,0.45772737,0.37056577
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans are too afraid to admit that they live within the middle of the bell curve. But I will say this: If you're in the middle of a bell curve and you take some risks, sometimes those risks don't work out and you die.",,0.6593126,0.33444995
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point where you know I felt like I wanted to push myself further. You know, at a certain point you just have to ask yourself do I want to be doing this? Because it's not always easy. It's not always comfortable and it's not always predictable.",,0.47793943,0.42898762
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think that it would be nice if we could all just calm down and not be so afraid of things that might kill us. But I also think that the world would be a much less interesting place if everyone was like me.,,0.7046004,0.51695436
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think.",,0.16148534,0.072078824
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not in a crazy way. I don't know. I just never felt the need to drink in order to like be social or whatever.",,0.43150696,0.68920743
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.

44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you. But if you have to work at being confident, then I think that's something that can be taught and developed.",,0.46125692,0.22146505
