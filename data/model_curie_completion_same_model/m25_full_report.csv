0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in El Salvador, where she runs an ESL school.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, like, that's a complicated question. Um, well, let's just say he's not the kind of guy you'd want to have a beer with.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," April 9, 1992.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," Where is she? What does she think about all this?"" And I think that those are the questions that people who aren't my mom ask most often.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who's going to be like, ""Oh, no matter what you do, it's gonna be all right. It's gonna be okay."" You know, like if I'm climbing a big wall it's like, ""No matter what happens, you're safe. You're protected."" If I get in an accident it's not life or death. It doesn't really matter about me. Like my sister is always there to make me feel better and keep me motivated and stuff.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She's like Russian, she's like fluent in French. She was born in France and her family moved to Israel when she was young. So she grew up speaking French and then English, but not really Hebrew. And then my dad, he grew up in the Soviet Union, so he spoke Russian all his life. But they both learned English basically through school systems and stuff like that.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably because they were both climbers themselves. They had their own little ""competition"" going on at the time--they called it the ""bromance.""",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and basically live with these families in their homes and see how they lived and write reports on that. And so it was kind of a crazy job, but I think my dad's idea was that if he could show by example how you should live your life then maybe the people who are reading his report will take those ideas home with them and start living better lives.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the guys that I read were all kind of old-school. You know, like classic mountaineers-style heroes are John Long and parties like him. But um but also people like Erickson and Bill Ramsey and Tim Kemple and those kinds of people. People who were doing cutting-edge climbing in the 1960s and '70s.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of it,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the moves, the permanence of the climate. It's just this huge, solemn reminder that you're small and your life is fleeting.""",0.85714287,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I mean, I eat everything.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was called the Zodiac Climber. It was to be a big wall in the Valley--maybe Yosemite or even Zion--but on land rather than on rock. The idea was to climb up one side of the valley and then down the other, using only zodiacs (canoes) and portage bags (backpack). The portage bags were sort of like oversize day packs that you could carry with one hand while you paddled with the other. You'd fill them with rocks and use them to build up sections of wall. It's kind of hard core: pure alpine style.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new. The problem is that as you get older, you start to look around and say, ""Hey, there's a lot of old guys here.""",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing team, or did you sell them some product?
But basically it was a sponsorship for me by Tommy Caldwell and his film company. They made a movie about my life story, so they were kind of sponsoring the whole deal.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really say, other than the fact that I really like to learn and I like to grow.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty crazy day, because we got up that route at 4:00 p.m., and it wasn’t due to rise for another six hours. So we had this whole evening ahead of us, and we were like kids in a candy store. We climbed all over El Capitan, just exploring its vastness. And then we finished off the traverse with this amazing 5:30 light!",,0.6681472,0.46678585
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I mean, I use a harness and a rope to belay myself, but that's it. And sometimes I climb without a rope at all. But what I do is very safe. It may not be for everybody, but it definitely makes me better climber. When you practice free soloing or climbing without a rope, you learn how to control your fear. You build confidence and become more comfortable with being in the moment.",,0.39869276,0.6249389
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it really affect my performance. But it's always there, you know. You just have to deal with it.",,0.48732123,0.53886116
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, so we lived all over the state, but mostly in the mountains. I went to high school in Red Rocks, which is a town near Las Vegas. Graduated from high school there. Then I moved to Yosemite and sort of lived in the Valley my whole life.",,0.51133436,0.7450373
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I've been practicing the moves on El Cap for years and never really committed to doing them in the rain, or at night, when I had my headlamp. It all comes down to preparation and rehearsal.",,0.5832366,0.56571335
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth the effort?"" The answer, I think, is that I ask myself these questions every day. It's a constant process of calibration, as I move between different projects and different places.",,0.8472603,0.16884422
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do will help you become more comfortable with being in a position of vulnerability, where you're outside of your comfort zone. And so I think all my climbs are sort of preparation for soloing.",,0.56576,0.6932941
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on what each particular project demands.",,0.5235032,0.4607494
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going and how we can do things better. And then act on those thoughts when they're ready.",,0.770013,0.5016911
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to people. I was too young to climb anything but little routes. But I sat in the car all night and looked through the windows at all the climbers going up on El Capitan. It was kind of a life-changing experience.""",,0.40432465,0.4697886
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in the case of Tommy Caldwell, whose bold free solos have earned him the reputation as ""the most talented climber in the world.""",,0.9026245,0.4461683
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," When other people get asked about climbing training, they sometimes talk about it in a negative way. They say that training is for wimps. Or else they criticize those who train too hard, saying that it's impossible to improve at such a high level without giving up some of the natural talent that you were born with. Both of these criticisms have some validity. It's true that most climbers don't spend much time training, and those who do are criticized for being soft or not having ""natural talent."" But I think the positive side of the equation gets overlooked. For me, learning how to climb has been a deeply satisfying process of self-discovery and growth, one that has made me a better person than I was before I started. And as for improving at an elite level without training? That's exactly what makes Olympic gold possible—the combination of raw talent and hours upon hours of practice on a specific task.",,0.6074541,0.5563209
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. Through trying something new and then figuring out what works and what doesn't. The things that I've figured out through trial and error, other people probably think are crazy. But it's those kinds of crazy ideas that lead to the greatest climbs.",,0.74446726,0.6022252
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no pro-level athletes from my home country of Switzerland. There are now two pro climbers from Switzerland but they're both relatively young and they haven't really done anything yet. So I thought it would be cool if I could find a way to support Swiss athletes who were trying to make the transition into professional climbing.",,0.5636203,0.34664544
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked me.,,0.42789915,0.08419425
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That I'm a high-risk, high-reward sort of professional athlete. That my life is somehow defined by the challenges that I take on. And to some extent, you're right. My life has been shaped by the challenges that I've chosen. But it's also true that if you look at the numbers, if you look at how many times I've fallen off and how many times I've survived, it's pretty amazing that I'm still here.",,0.48267725,0.48986834
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about my experiences as a climber, that people would want to hear more about those kinds of stories.",,0.5438023,0.5749994
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But then, on the other hand, I've also done a lot of things that most people would consider completely safe. So which is the real me?",,0.7306235,0.46530068
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would call it a hobby, but back in the day, when people asked me if I wanted to climb Mount Everest, my answer was always no. Now that I've done it three times (still have yet to top out on the highest), maybe I can say yes? Maybe not. We'll see.",,0.73254836,0.4798957
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing in the Valley and I fell off and I broke my leg, you know that could be a really long recovery process.",,0.5089046,0.38600653
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of risk they're talking about is the safe, predictable kind.",,0.55431926,0.4737641
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to see what else is out there.",,0.46716693,0.31726938
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be healthier for all of us.,,0.63978994,0.18896088
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone can understand I think you know, like what I mean by that is that if you look at my childhood and my relationship with nature was very close but as i've gotten older it's become more of a professional relationship. You know, where i'm like actually need to work on this project or that project in order to achieve certain things. And now, as a result of that, you know I really value the professional relationship with nature and so when something does go wrong for whatever reason. You know, am I still able to be connected with nature? Do I still have access to nature? Do we have any plans for next year? Like all these kinds of questions start coming up because nowadays everything is sort of interwoven right so if your personal life is not going well then your work life isn't going well. It's all tied together right so if your personal life starts falling apart then there's probably something wrong with the plan for next year yeah exactly and so far i've always been able to find some kind of way through it all just by being connected to nature which i'll get into in a minute but um but certainly there are moments in time where you're like oh no this is definitely affecting me personally and there are other times where it seems less acute maybe because you're traveling or something like that but uh yeah it's always there though, whenever anything goes wrong it's always good to go back home and reconnect with momma earth.",,0.20981506,0.31718755
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think that I do. I like to drink, but I don't like to get totally fucked up.",,0.65020406,0.63411576
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't like to be afraid, but i'm glad that i'm capable of feeling it. It means that i'm alive and aware, and able to feel pleasure and pain.",,0.66687155,0.50281185
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes through. If you're not naturally a confident person, then I don't know... maybe work hard at it?",,0.30268154,0.28459063
