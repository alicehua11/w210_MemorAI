0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active in local politics and charity work.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," Why does everyone keep asking me that? I don't have a dad. My mom is married to some dude in Texas, but he doesn't know anything about raising a daughter. Or maybe he does and he's just not into it. It's hard to say because I've never met him.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," April 9, 1992.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick, Where is she? What does she look like? How do I describe her? These are all questions that I think about a lot.,0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to give a cell phone so she can reach me in case of emergency.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," English. My mom: ""Hi, I'm Mieka and I'd like to talk about your dad.""",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They didn't really push me into it, though; they just thought it looked fun. When I was around eight or nine, though, my sister went to the same gym and started taking gymnastics classes there. That's how I got into rock climbing--mostly through watching my sister. She's two years older than me, so she was already doing some pretty hardcore stuff.",0.6666667,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and evaluate how well various projects were going to affect the environment.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the writers that I read were all kind of old-school: Peter Croft and John Long and Bill Ramsey. You know, these are guys who wrote books about climbing. And then more recently Mark Synnott has been a big influence on me. He's just such an amazing writer. His stories are so evocative and he paints such vivid pictures in your mind of what it was like to be there.",0.6666667,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the climbing, and the permanence of the consequences if you screw up. The first time I climbed it, I was with Alex Lowe. We got to the top of Freerider in about four hours, but it took us two days to get all the moves down pat. Once we were ready, we climbed it in about an hour and a half.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," Eggs and bacon. What else? Hash browns. Oh, God, I can't eat eggs anymore. That's one of the many things I can't eat anymore--eggs, cheese, meat--because of my allergies.",0.5,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was a project in the High Sierra that I've always loved: to climb the three highest peaks in the range in one day. (The Triple Crown of Yosemite.) That's been my dream for as long as I can remember.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the Sierras. We didn't really have a favorite mountain range per se, but we did have a favorite climbing area which was the Valley when you're talking about Yosemite. The reason that valley is so great is because of all the different faces there are, almost every single one of which has been climbed at least once. There's just this incredible wealth of climbs and that's what I love most about mountains is discovering new routes and finding old routes re-discovered.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing team, or did you sell them some fancy gear?
But yeah, so The North Face was actually kind of a client of mine. I had worked with their brand manager before to develop a line of products and they were one of my sponsors. So it was nice to kind of like finally bring that product to market and have them be excited about it. ",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really answer that. I mean, I think that there's a lot of motivation to be found in the sense that you're doing something for the first time and it's scary and you don't know if you're going to get it right. And so there's a little bit of fear involved but also an incredible sense of excitement.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huberdihedral Wall in Switzerland, the Piola-Anker in Italy, and finally El Cap. The first four are all big walls.",,0.4407923,0.31917512
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope you can understand.",,0.5789876,0.10603634
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it dictate how I feel about something that i'm interested in. You know, if there's a wall that I want to climb and i'm afraid of the wall then I just don't do it. If there's some other thing that i'm interested in then i'll just focus on that. But if it's something that is truly scary then maybe its best left alone.",,0.6951084,0.671683
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it. ",,0.19842647,0.12748942
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry and my mom taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a community college. They were both kind of into climbing themselves. We didn’t go on too many vacations because work was always crazy busy, but when we did go camping or hiking it was always in the backcountry of someplace like Yosemite or Red Rocks near Las Vegas.",,0.4207243,0.6831619
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I've been practicing the moves on El Cap for years and never had the focus to do it safely. Then one day, everything came together perfectly. It was like I had practiced for years, and now I was ready.",,0.6471465,0.57108647
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or if I just have blind faith that things will work out?",,0.94965005,0.25713956
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. And so ultimately free soloing is just a matter of being comfortable in your own skin and being able to trust your abilities.",,0.48437616,0.617612
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of an individual pursuit, but it's also fun to work with a partner on a project. It all depends on the circumstances and the people involved.",,0.48022446,0.41869086
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing is much more straightforward. I mean, with Honnold Foundation, I definitely feel like we're trying to do something that's never been done before. You know, like the idea of a rock climbing foundation is pretty new and exciting. And so with Honnold Foundation we're trying to support environmental and humanitarian causes that are near and dear to Peter's heart. But you know it's always nice when your personal life aligns with your professional life as well.",,0.6167633,0.4979292
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to people. I was too young to climb anything but little toddler routes. But I sat in the car happily playing with my Legos for an hour or two, then wandered over to what seemed like the most obvious big wall route around. It turned out to be a 5.10c route called The Rostrum--not a great sign if you're climbing by yourself without any gear. But I climbed it anyway, just because it looked fun.",,0.48638684,0.39529064
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for them? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in guiding. For years, the conventional wisdom among climbers has been that you shouldn't mix less-experienced partners or roped buddies on a big wall. The reasoning is that if your partner is less experienced, they might be more likely to get scared and pull off the route before it's finished--even if you are belaying them. And if their talent isn't up to the task, it could result in both of you dying horrible deaths on the wall.",,0.7617887,0.6146134
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," When other people watch me train, they probably think I'm crazy. They must think I spend all my time climbing up and down the walls of the gym. But that's not what training is about for me. If I'm in the middle of a workout, and an audience shows up, I try to keep going rather than stopping to talk or answer questions. That's because what I'm doing in the gym is more important than who's watching.",,0.8319004,0.52620494
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" In some sense, they're both just synonyms for ""lowest point in my life,"" which is certainly not a phrase I ever want to hear applied to myself. But in another sense, those words capture the two most significant moments of change in my climbing career. The low points have always been followed by high points, and these two represent the highest I've climbed so far.",,0.82866234,0.4323365
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, ten. And ever since then it's been this sort of driving force in my life. It's not so much about the money as it is about just doing something that I'm really excited about.",,0.47834107,0.46384394
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could if it meant not climbing at all. But that's not really an option. Not for me, anyway.",,0.6127114,0.17196882
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. There are all these things you hear about famous climbers getting killed or falling off cliffs and not surviving. That's what keeps me from climbing too much: the fear that I might die before my time.",,0.7833209,0.27393335
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about my experiences as a climber, that people would want to hear more about those stories.",,0.5259533,0.5782098
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are things that I do that most people would consider to be quite dangerous, and maybe they are, maybe I'm just an idiot for doing them. But then again, look at BASE jumping. Most people consider that to be extremely dangerous and perhaps even suicidal. And yet a lot of very famous athletes have done it, including wingsuit pilots like Ueli Steck and Dean Potter. So has anybody ever died doing something asinine?",,0.63789785,0.3251133
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would call it a hobby, but back in the day, when people asked me if I wanted to climb Mount Everest, my answer was always no. Now that I've done it three times (still have yet to top out on the highest mountain), maybe I can say yes? Maybe not? We'll see.",,0.7228168,0.46731317
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," Probably not. But it does help to remember that I could fall at any moment, which helps keep things in perspective.",,0.46037665,0.30477262
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of risk they're taking is the safe, secure, middle-class risk.",,0.555841,0.48741633
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to see what else is out there.",,0.46716693,0.31726938
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I think that it would be nice if we could all just calm down and not be so afraid of things that are potentially dangerous. But I also think that you can’t really change other people, or the world, and you should just try to make the best of it.",,0.64187443,0.49028847
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone can understand I think that we are all connected to each other and everything on earth is connected to something else. And so when you start cutting things like that, you know it affects everybody.",,0.4309009,0.23194523
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think that I do. I like to drink socially. You know, I've been known to drink a little bit of alcohol, but only when it's in the context of a fun night out with friends and stuff.",,0.6552433,0.54808074
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away or become too comfortable. If you're doing something that's new and scary then it's good to be afraid, it means your body is ready for what comes next.",,0.5733243,0.64644057
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that you can't really buy confidence or self-belief. It's more about, like, cultivating it and learning how to build it and then being in the right place at the right time. And I think that anything in life that is worth doing is going to take a little bit of luck on your side as well. You know, so if you're trying to climb a big wall like this one here, which is obviously totally insane and out of reach for most people, even if you had all the confidence in the world it would still probably be too scary for you. So I think that any great achievement in life requires some degree of luck on your side as well.",,0.5883381,0.34280592
