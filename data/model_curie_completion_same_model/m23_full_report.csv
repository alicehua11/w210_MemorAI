0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. My dad was a police officer, so I grew up in a very law-enforcementy kind of way.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, obviously I thought he was my dad and then, like, found out he wasn't.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985",","" I asked. ""October 2, 1989,"" he replied. ""I'll be twenty-one in a few days.""",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," Where is she? What does she look like? How did I get here?"" are the kinds of questions that most kids don't ask.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who's going to be like, ""Oh, he just climbed a random lady."" No, no. I mean there are plenty of guys out there that would consider me their sister just for being friends with them and hanging out and doing activities together. But yeah, so my actual biological sister is two years older than me and she's an amazing climber too. So we're kind of climbing rivals or something which is funny because we haven't really competed against each other except in training which has been sort of indirectly through our kids right.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. And then they'd talk French to me because I speak French, so it kind of evens out. My dad's side of the family is from France, his mom was born in France, his granddad was a senator in France. So he grew up with all this history around him and then he went and lived in Canada for 20 years and now they're all back in France.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three. They didn't really push me into it, though; they just thought it looked fun. When I was around eight or nine, my sister went to the same gym and started taking gymnastics classes there. That's how she got into climbing too, through her sister!",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to work on a weather satellite. So he was nomadic, basically. He'd move from one place to another every few months as the contractor moved its base of operations. It was kind of like being a traveling salesman for the government.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, Tommy Caldwell and the whole climbing documentary genre is what I call cinema. You know, like actual film that you go to the movies theater for. Like with actual sound and everything.",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than you ever dreamed it would be, the complexity of the moves. It's just such a huge challenge.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," Eggs and bacon. I like to cook them myself, on a stove top. No microwave. What's my lunch? Depends on the day. Sometimes leftovers from breakfast, if I'm eating out or something. What do I eat with one hand while i'm peeing with the other? Why is my thumb so big? That's because I have particularly large hands.",0.5,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was a project in the High Sierra that I've always loved: to climb the three highest peaks in the range in one day. (The Triple Crown of Yosemite.) That's been my goal in the High Sierra for as long as I can remember. But more than any specific peak, I've always dreamed of climbing all four Yosemite faces on one day--the north face of Mount Watkins (easier than it sounds), followed by the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome, then the Original Route on El Capitan, and finally the King Swing across Devil's Bay to access Red Rocks. The idea is pretty far-fetched, given that you'd have to climb nearly 14,000 feet in a single day. But it's an amazing challenge!",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or did you do other stuff that they were into? I think the thing with The North Face is that they have a bunch of different brands. They're sort of a conglomeration of different companies that all kind of specialize in different things. My understanding is that The North Face was started by this guy named Garin who specialized in manufacturing high-quality backpacks. And then over time, as the company has grown and diversified, they've sort of taken on other clients and now sponsor climbers and hikers and people who climb walls and all kinds of folks. But at its core, I think The North Face still focuses on making quality products for outdoor enthusiasts.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really say, other than the fact that I really like to learn and I like to grow.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty amazing climb. Fourth is the Astroman, also with Ueli Steck, but only because he filmed me doing it and then sent the film to Germany for broadcast on TV as a documentary about free soloing. (The German title translates as “The Soloist Who Doesn’t Need a Helicopter!”)",,0.53889704,0.32910556
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? I practice free soloing and roped climbing in a gym to get used to controlling my fear.",,0.6127403,0.55167234
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it dictate how I feel about climbing or anything. It's just there but it doesn't really matter because at the end of the day it's just a wall.",,0.58452666,0.439771
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, which is sort of a precursor to the Park Service. He was a forest supervisor, basically managing other people’s private land for them and doing work on it himself. We lived in these little villages scattered throughout the mountains, tiny little houses that cost like $100,000 each.",,0.6073123,0.58401155
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's a combination of factors. I've always been somewhat of a perfectionist, so the idea of having to perform a task perfectly has always appealed to me. And then there's the matter of preparation--training and rehearsing until you have an almost mechanical ability to do something that seems impossible. It's like riding a bike: Once you learn how, you never forget.",,0.69981813,0.52250147
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or if I just have blind faith that things will work out?",,0.94965005,0.25713956
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climbing that you do helps prepare you for free soloing. But, like, to say that my climbs are all focused on preparing me for a free solo is maybe a little bit of a stretch.",,0.5586417,0.7585566
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on what each particular project demands.",,0.5235032,0.4607494
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more mindfulness focused. I mean, when you're free soloing or aid climbing, you're totally focused on what you're doing. It's kind of like a meditation for me. With the Honnold Foundation, it's a little bit more about just creating awareness and getting people to think about their own behavior and how they can change it. You know, whether that means changing their diet or something small like that but just making an effort on a personal level.",,0.62136674,0.39062136
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to somebody. I was scared shitless. I thought I was going to die of asphyxiation! But then I realized that if I could climb 1,500 feet up a wall just by myself, without any equipment, then maybe I could figure out how to get down safely. So I started climbing right away. It wasn't hard for me at all--I literally just climbed until my fingers hurt and my toes hurt and it felt like too much effort to go on. Then I'd stop and wait for nightfall. At first it was kind of fun being in the dark all alone in a strange place with nothing around you for hundreds of feet straight down.",,0.52141196,0.45071644
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for them? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in guiding. For years, the standard approach to less-than-stellar partners has been for the more experienced climber to "" belay ""--that is, hang from devices such as a rope or harness and use their body weight to keep the other person (the ""client"") safe on the wall. The client then gets little or no credit for the actual climbing.",,0.68357384,0.53581816
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they feel about it? I think the general public thinks of climbing as a kind of extreme sport, and that's what you see with the guys like Tommy Caldwell or El Capitan. But actually, most climbers are very methodical. They spend hours and hours practicing their moves in the gym. Or they'll hike to some amazing boulder problem that only occurs maybe once every fifty years, or so, and then spend days working it out on the wall.",,0.6703262,0.64416975
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. The more I climb, the more I learn about what works and doesn't work. Through years of hard-won experience, I've slowly figured out what techniques and gear make for a successful ascent. And then there's just plain old luck--the good kind, like getting in a lucky break or finding an overlooked route with minimal traffic.",,0.6978469,0.5958521
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years, but then I kind of grew out of it. And now at age 34, I've got kids that I want to climb with and do other things. So the idea of creating an organization that supports both sides of the spectrum is something that's been percolating in my mind for a while.",,0.6087949,0.38355887
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it."," I mean, I could if it meant not climbing at all. But that's not really an option. If I'm going to do this, then I need to do it right.",,0.69272196,0.22850464
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so when I started thinking about El Cap and how it would fit into my life story, you know I was like well this is another chapter in my book of courage.",,0.47910523,0.5632516
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But then, on the other hand, I've never been hurt doing them.",,0.6275245,0.4138878
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would call it a hobby, but back in the day, when people asked me if I wanted to climb mountains, I would say no. Now that i've done it, I don't know what i'd call it.",,0.7491778,0.42834428
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing on a lower pitch and I fell off, that wouldn't necessarily be the end of my world. But when you're free soloing or doing big walls, it's pretty much game over if you fall off.",,0.60025406,0.5380646
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of climbing I'm doing now is so much more extreme than anything most people are doing.",,0.57567155,0.40108198
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to go as far as I could with climbing.",,0.44276863,0.4184723
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be nice if we could all just take a deep breath and relax.,,0.7183931,0.30832306
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think. I think that my relationship with nature is more intimate than a lot of people might realize.",,0.3769092,0.5954958
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think that I do. I like to drink, but I don't like to get totally fucked up.",,0.65020406,0.63411576
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away or become too comfortable. If you're doing something that's new and challenging for you, then it's natural to be a little afraid.",,0.65618634,0.6449398
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that you can't really buy confidence and self-belief. It's more about, like, cultivating it and learning how to build it up. And I think that the biggest thing for me was just having a clear goal in mind. Having a very specific idea of what I wanted to achieve and then working towards that with determination and focus.",,0.56579137,0.39898577
