0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's an active real estate agent.",1.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," What is my dad? What happened to me? Am I dead?"" And then, once you get those questions answered, ""What's next?""",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to bring home from the bar. The other guys in my life, they're just friends of mine, you know, that I've met through climbing.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke Italian to my dad. So I grew up speaking Italian, English, and a little bit of Spanish.",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably too young to remember. They were like, ""Oh, here's this kid at the climbing gym that's kind of weird,"" and then they'd wait outside for me to come down.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically, they were like, ""We're going to send him to these exotic places and give him this crazy budget and see if he can sort of make it work."" And so far he's done all these amazing things.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the writers that I read were all kind of old-school: Peter Croft and John Long and Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay. Those are the climbing writers I grew up reading. But um but also guys like Alpinist, like Mark Twight or Cedar Wright or Jimmy Chin or Renan Ozturk or Tim Kemple or James Pearson or Tom Evans or anybody else who's just writing great stories about great climbs.",1.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the climbing, and the fact that it's been largely untouched by humans. Imagine trying to find a path through a jungle when you're lost. That's what it feels like to climb El Cap.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I just eat what's available. Like if there's eggs or something, I'll eat the eggs. If there's bread, I'll eat the bread. You know, if there's jam, I'll spread the jam.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was a project in the High Sierra that I'd been dreaming about for years, which was to climb the three highest peaks in the range--Mount Watkins, Mount Tallac, and Mount Liberty--in a single day. The other two were to climb El Capitan and Half Dome in one day. Both of those are very big projects that would require a lot of preparation and training, but they're still within my capabilities if circumstances ever allowed.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think the favorite for all of us was Yosemite. We would go every year from 2010 to 2014. It's such a beautiful place and it inspired me and my dad so much that--I mean, he had his book published in 2010, which was the same year that I started climbing seriously. And then we'd go back every summer and do research and write articles about the trip.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or the film project? Or was it both?
But yeah, so The North Face has been a sponsor of mine for years. And I think they were maybe persuaded to sponsor me by my film projects or maybe by both. But you know, I mean The North Face makes great products and so does not sponsoring me make them better. It's just a good partnership all around.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it was a combination of things, I mean there were certainly moments where it felt like this is too hard and that's not fair and that's not right. But then you know when you look around at the whole climbing community and you see all these people having fun traveling the world, having great times with friends doing cool things. And you're like well this is pretty awesome right. You know I'm lucky to have such a great life and great career.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Aguja Val Biois, and the two routes on El Cap. Yeah, I did all those in one year alone. In winter. Alone.",,0.3521693,0.46569335
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope this makes sense to you.",,0.6523257,0.103596166
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, I don't think that I'm capable of doing a big free solo. Maybe 50 meters, you know, up to the edge of danger. But then once I'm there, it's not really about fear anymore. It's just about executing.",,0.6771591,0.62572724
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, but moved to the Bay Area when I was very young. My parents still live in the South Bay. I went to high school in San Jose and graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in environmental studies. And then I did my graduate work at UCLA, finishing up there about five years ago.",,0.8442469,0.50522316
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer. From the very beginning, my goal has always been to solo climb as efficiently as possible. I've tried to develop techniques that maximize my climbing potential while minimizing the impact on the environment. For instance, I use a harness and daisies (a type of anchor) instead of a rope when belaying. I minimize the number of pitches I lead, and I even downclimb or upclimb routes in order to save on rope drag.",,0.61545753,0.68482554
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm being prudent or just being afraid?,,0.9406963,0.38583672
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do helps to build confidence, and so the more climbs you do the more confident you become. And so I think free soloing does help to build your confidence but it's not like i'm specifically doing it because i'm trying to prepare for a free solo.",,0.40112212,0.68701303
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on what each particular project demands.",,0.5235032,0.4607494
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, compared to his super intense training regimen and focus on performance it's pretty easy for me. I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and how we can make things better but then I also just let things happen naturally.",,0.6983256,0.5786122
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to somebody. I was scared shitless. I thought I was going to die of dehydration or something.",,0.48560393,0.38823187
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make sure we're both having fun? What should we climb next?"" These are all fair questions, and they all come down to this: How do you keep the peace? The best way I've found is to approach it from a standpoint of mutual respect. If Alex wants to solo, or even rope up with a friend less experienced than he is, that's cool with me. If I want to rope up with a friend less talented than I am, that's cool with him. It goes without saying that if we're both climbing selfishly--that is, just for the sake of climbing--then there's no room for negotiation.",,0.80152774,0.4950757
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success.", Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they deal with the stress of knowing that what they are doing might lead to their deaths?,,0.9668835,0.6415568
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. The more I climb, the better I get. It's a cumulative process. When you make a mistake, it's because you're not yet ready for it. So when is someone really ready to try something new? When they've already done it before and know that they can handle it.",,0.8168235,0.5587941
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years. And then eventually, as you do with any hobby, you kind of outgrow it. You know, you get into your early 30s and you're like yeah this is cool but i'm not quite as passionate anymore. And so for me the appeal of doing something nonclimbing related has always been in the mission side of things. The actual act of giving and helping people has always felt super virtuous to me.",,0.5321082,0.259565
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked.,,0.22021735,0.048222497
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," Well, I suppose the thing that scares me most is failure. Not so much of a fear as an anxiety-producing nagging doubt. The sort of doubt that's with you all the time, even if it doesn't show on your face, because you're too busy performing to let it surface. You know what I mean?",,0.3631461,0.3328088
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, where you have these sort of codes of honor and things are done secretly because they're considered to be shameful if they're exposed. And so I think that free soloing is just taking it one step further. It's saying, ""You know what? These things should be out in the open. They should be celebrated.""",,0.48158112,0.41017845
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I think that there are a lot of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or at least highly risky, and yet, because I've prepared for them for years and years and years, they don't faze me at all. It's not like i'm going up on this big wall thinking Oh my God, I'm about to die! It's just not in my thought process.",,0.6309185,0.511706
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would call it a hobby, but back in the day, when people asked me if I wanted to climb Mount Everest, my answer was always no. Now that I've done it three times (still got an obsession), maybe I can say a little bit more informed yes.",,0.6066513,0.4651392
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it’s important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was climbing in a gym and I slipped on a handrail or something, my body would just go over the side. But you still kind of wonder, right? Like what if this really does happen and I don’t get to tell anybody about it.",,0.6063144,0.42092335
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of climbing I'm doing now is so much more dangerous than what most people are doing in their daily lives.",,0.5721879,0.43095958
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to see what else is out there.",,0.46716693,0.31726938
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be nice if we could all just take a deep breath and relax.,,0.7183931,0.30832306
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone can understand I think, you know I love being outside iI don’t like being inside iI really like talking to trees and rocks and things. So my relationship with nature is close but non-intimate.",,0.054124497,0.6970455
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think that I do. I like to drink socially. I don't like to drink when I'm performing.",,0.6253398,0.63536185
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away or become too comfortable. If you're afraid, it means you're alive and aware and your brain is functioning. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's just something to work through.",,0.7479946,0.5889995
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you. But if you have to work at being confident, then I think that's kind of harder.",,0.4476273,0.29498097
