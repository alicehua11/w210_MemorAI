6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about five or six. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably around three or four. They were both climbers themselves--my dad was a pretty serious climber, my mom did some too, though not at the level of competition. She taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a community college and her classes were in the Berkeley campus gym.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and basically live with these families in their homes and see how they lived and write reports on that. And so it was sort of a combination of being a house-sitter combined with doing some actual fieldwork.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously, John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then later on, when I started writing about climbing myself, you know, like in my late 20s or early 30ies. I read all the Peter Croft books and The Life and Times of David Gaylor and all that. And then more recently Mark Twight who wrote about climbing in Alaska.",1.0,,

It's not that I thought I could actually do it, but at least I knew that if I tried, I would at least be doing what's right.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty amazing climb. Fourth is the Astroman, also with Ueli Steck, in 2008. Fifth is the Zodiac Wall on El Cap with Tommy Caldwell in 2007. And sixth is the Freerider at Moonlight Buttress with Kevin Regan in 2004. And seventh is Sendero Torre Traverse, also with Ueli Steck and Patagonia in 2010--the hardest big wall free climb ever done!",,0.5693375,0.39794034
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? I practice free soloing and roped climbing in a gym to get used to controlling my fear.",,0.6127403,0.55167234
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, you know. I don't let it really affect my performance. But it's always there, you know. You just have to kind of ignore it and not let it bother you as much.",,0.57661086,0.5168289
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it. ",,0.19842647,0.12748942
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry. He was a climber himself, taught me a lot of stuff when I was a kid. When I went to college, it was like a crazy love affair with Yosemite and the Sierras.",,0.5427767,0.74589443
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer, because the process is so obvious. You just have to want it enough. When I was a kid, I read books about famous climbers like Warren Harding and Royal Robbins, and I thought, These are the guys that I want to be when I grow up. Then, as I got older and realized how hard they had to work to get where they were, that motivation only grew stronger. By the time I was twenty-five or -six, climbing had become my favorite hobby (though still by far my most dangerous one), and all those heroes seemed like ancient history.",,0.59396577,0.45339146
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most important? How do I know if I'm making the right choices? The best way I can sum it up is to paraphrase a line from one of my favorite movies, Risky Business. Risks are what make life interesting, and it's our choices that define us. If you've ever wondered about my climbing goals for the coming year, here they are. . . .""I choose to climb things that scare me.""",,0.60613555,0.4756999
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I think that any climb that you do will help you become more comfortable with being in an uncomfortable position. And so, as I was saying before, the idea of being stuck in a harness for days on end is not that scary if it's just for a short time.",,0.59121776,0.60891944
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that requires a lot of preparation and work from a soloist, then executing it perfectly on the day of. But I also like working with other people. It's nice to have another person in the room who knows what they're doing, who can answer questions and offer advice along the way. In some ways, being with other people makes life easier--especially when you have a good partner like Jimmy Chin who can belay you or help you with gear.",,0.42480984,0.5255174
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going and how we can do things better. And I think that's reflected in the way that I live my life.",,0.76521575,0.48337364
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to get something to eat. I was too young to climb anything but little toddler routes. But I found a bag of chalk in the backseat, so I figured out some climbs of my own. Got down on my knees and started chalking myself up. It felt amazing! Like nothing else mattered except for that moment of self-expression through climbing.",,0.44738537,0.49653584
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in the case of Tommy, who is less experienced and less talented than I am. The truth is that we've never really talked about any of this. When we climb together, it's just like riding a bike--neither of us says anything nor does anything fancy. We just go up and have fun.",,0.69838846,0.4511005
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," When other people watch me train, they probably think I'm crazy. They must think I spend all my time climbing up and down the walls of the gym. But that's not what training is about for me. For me, training is a means to an end: to be ready when it matters most. If you ask me if I feel ready, the answer has to be no. But I don't feel like it's important to feel ready before you do something dangerous. You have to trust your preparation and know that if you follow the steps carefully, nothing bad can happen.",,0.7285807,0.5582704
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer is pretty simple. Patience. Persistence. Determination. Grinding it out over many years until you finally achieve your goal, whether that be soloing the Nose or free soloing Moonlight Buttress.",,0.39379203,0.47655904
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years. And then eventually, as you do with any hobby, you kind of outgrow it. You know, you get into your early to mid-20s and you're like ""This is cool,"" but by the time I was in my late-20s, I wasn't as passionate about it anymore. And so for me the appeal of giving back came from an actual desire to help other people have fun in the mountains too.",,0.5958652,0.24266556
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked me.,,0.42789915,0.08419425
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," Well, I think that at some point, probably around the age of thirty-five or forty, you start to think about it a little more. You know, like ""Oh my God, am I ready for this?""",,0.51923436,0.28225753
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time.," That's a big part of what drew me to the project in the first place. I love that kind of juxtaposition, especially when it comes with a sense of mystery and adventure.",,0.82443345,0.2365402
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about my experiences as a climber, that people would accuse me of being a little bit crazy.",,0.5226152,0.6266863
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But I've always found those challenges to be incredibly exciting.",,0.6768052,0.39723772
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be aware of what your options are. I don't know if I'll go and live in a van or move into an abandoned building or something, but I do know that I want to keep exploring and traveling.",,0.6419039,0.23769766
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think about it all the time.",,0.75546765,0.13910484
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of risk that we're talking about here is a little bit more extreme than what most people are comfortable with.",,0.5682013,0.41952822
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point where you know I felt like I wanted to push myself further. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just depends on your current situation.",,0.46882832,0.4348977
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think that it would be nice if we could all just calm down a little bit and not be so afraid of the dark.,,0.6940052,0.4239066
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think. I like to drink socially. I don't like to drink when I'm performing.",,0.63834167,0.6383147
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away or become too comfortable. If you're doing something that's new and scary then it's good to be afraid, it means your body is ready for what comes next.",,0.5733243,0.64644057
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that you can't really buy confidence or self-belief. It's more about, like, cultivating it and learning how to build it and then being in the right place at the right time.
