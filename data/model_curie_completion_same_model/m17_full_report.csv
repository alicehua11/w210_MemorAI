0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active in local politics and philanthropy.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, like, that's a tough one. Um. My dad died when he was 43 years old, so it was pretty sudden and unexpected.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," June 19, 1995.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," What is my dad? Am I adopted? These are all questions that kids ask. And they're questions that I asked when I was, like, seven or eight.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who's going to be like, ""Oh, he just climbed with her. It's totally casual."" No, I don't have a sister. But you know what I mean.",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. And then they'd speak English to me because I was an American kid. So I didn't really grow up with a lot of French language, you know, exposure or anything like that. But now that I'm older and I live in France, it's kind of nice to be able to talk about sports with your mom and have her explain the rules and stuff in French so you get it right.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably too young to remember. They were like, ""Oh, here's Johnny,"" and then would leave for whatever reason. ",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessments of potential new oil and gas leases in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. So basically they would send him out to these remote villages in Alaska, like Native communities, get them all together in one place, and then have a helicopter fly him in between them to check their living conditions. He did that for several years.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge inspiration. And then later on in life, you know, when he was like in his 50s and 60s, you read all these adventure writers from the 19th century. Like guys like Mungo Park and Robert Fitzroy and Richard Francis Burton. All these great British explorers who were basically just given free rein to roam across the globe by the Royal Geographical Society back in the day. They had this program where they would give grants for long-term exploration of uncharted territory. So these are kind of the original rock climbers!",0.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than anything else out there, the complexity of the moves. It's just such an incredible challenge.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I mean, I eat the same things every morning, which is kind of weird because my kitchen's like this tiny little space in my apartment. You know, just a couple of eggs and some fruit and maybe some toast. But it's like the first meal of the day that you can basically do in your pajamas if you want to.",0.8,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've had several. One was a project in the High Sierra that I'd been dreaming about for years, which was to climb the three highest peaks in the range--Mount Watkins, Mount Tallac, and Mount Liberty--in a single day. And then link them into a continuous ridge line. It's not quite as hard as climbing all three summits of Everest in a single day, because you only have to do it once (though it's pretty tough), but it's still pretty impressive.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or the film-making, or the writing? Or all of them?",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really answer that. I think for me the fun of it is definitely a big part of it. The challenge of it is another big part of it. The feeling of mastery, you know, when you're climbing something and then you finally climb it and you feel like ""Oh!"" That's a good motivator in its own right.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The first one is the Rostrum in Las Vegas. The second is the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome. The third is the Torre Traverse, which I did with Ueli Steck in 2009. That was a pretty crazy day, because we got up that route at 4:00 p.m., and it wasn’t due to rise for another six hours. So we spent the whole time climbing through pitch after pitch of sandstone dust, which really fucked with your sinuses. It was like being inside a giant cloud.",,0.68192923,0.5279837
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? What does it mean? I hope you can understand.",,0.5789876,0.10603634
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, basically. You know, I think about it less and less each time I do it.",,0.5191078,0.4824641
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, which is kind of a funny way to grow up and have a love affair with the forest.",,0.4450827,0.6194525
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer. From the very beginning, my goal has always been to free solo as many routes as I can. That's what I mean by ""developing the focus."" When I was a kid, that kind of focused goal seemed impossible. Now it seems obvious.",,0.7405172,0.56503826
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or if I just have blind faith that everything will work out OK?",,0.9360025,0.25368512
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I guess if you're going to do a free solo it's kind of like an audition or something, you know. Like are you ready for this? But um yeah all my climbs help in some way shape or form prepare me for that moment when i'm just standing there and i'm like ready.",,0.32929817,0.56568193
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of an individual pursuit, but it's also nice to have a partner there who can provide some emotional support. If I'm going to do something that's potentially dangerous, it helps to have a friend nearby who can help minimize the risk.",,0.43647364,0.36453915
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going and how we can do things better. And then act on those thoughts when they're ready.",,0.770013,0.5016911
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got to the base of El Cap at night. I didn't sleep that night, I was so excited. And then we climbed it in the dark. It was this big, looming presence above us as we moved through the woods toward the cliff. The next morning he brought me back to civilization and said, ""This is what you're going to do."" Just like that: ""This is what you're going to do.""",,0.3703774,0.59552824
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in the case of Tommy Caldwell, whose bold free solos have earned him the reputation as ""the best rock climber in the world."" As mentioned in chapter two, however, I think that tag is pretty overrated. Yes, he's incredibly talented--I've watched him solo more than a thousand feet up into the air with ease--but there are plenty of other climbers out there who could match or even surpass his feats.",,0.86903673,0.3970703
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers go about their business in a more casual way? Or do they all train like crazy? I'm fascinated by the question of how professional climbers prepare for big climbs. Do they have to memorize huge volumes of information, such as sequences of moves that might take them a dozen or more tries to perfect? Do they have to spend hours and hours doing specific exercises so that their fingers are perfectly flexible and their muscles are ready for whatever comes next? And if so, do they get paid for all this hard work? (I know some climbing gym owners who think that professional climbers make too much money! They think that if athletes got paid what they were worth, there'd be no money left in the sport.)",,0.761312,0.66474324
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" In some sense, they're both just synonyms for ""lowest point in my life,"" which is also probably why I'm so drawn to them.",,0.8312859,0.36430016
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years. But then I kind of grew out of it, you know. It's hard to keep that passion ignited after a while. So the idea with the foundation is just to help support people who are currently passionate about something and are maybe having trouble getting sponsors or whatever.",,0.5545375,0.48431176
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked.,,0.22021735,0.048222497
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the usual things.",,0.66317075,0.24371594
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's a big part of what attracted me to the project in the first place.,,0.713255,0.15244871
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, where you have this sort of elite group of guys who are really good at it and they're always talking about it and writing books about it and so on. And then you have the rest of us who just sort of watch these guys climb and wonder if we'll ever be as good as them. And I think that's kind of how climbing has played out for me over the last decade or so.",,0.5657685,0.5961697
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I would do if I had the opportunity that most people would find too scary. But then again, maybe not! Maybe society is wrong and you should always avoid danger like fear will kill your adventure.",,0.59842205,0.72895736
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to be open to new opportunities. I don't know if I would necessarily call it a priority, but it's something that has always interested me: What are the other possible lives out there for me? How do you define success?",,0.7593354,0.34640962
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable.", Yes. Do I think that my life is in danger? No. Do I think that any of us are really prepared for what we do? Probably not.,,0.50045544,0.3601607
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of risk that I'm talking about is the kind that most people wouldn't consider taking.",,0.5528215,0.3582003
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that you can get addicted to anything. But I think that the really interesting question is when does it become too dangerous and should we stop?",,0.7103285,0.32798946
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think that it would be nice if we could all just calm down a little bit and not be so afraid of the dark.,,0.6940052,0.4239066
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think. I mean you know, like when you hear the word bond it sounds a little bit corny but there is a real bond between me and nature that has been my life for most of my life and i'm very close to it.",,0.33415994,0.46162865
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not in a crazy way. Not like compulsively. I drink socially. I go to happy hours and stuff. But I don't know, I just never developed the taste for it. Maybe it's because i'm an Aries or something.",,0.5182663,0.6452476
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.

44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that you can't really buy confidence or self-belief. It's just the same as with any skill, if you're going to develop it, is that you have to practice.",,0.290393,0.40203238
