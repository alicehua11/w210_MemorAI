0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active in local politics and philanthropy.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," Why does everyone keep asking me that? I don't have a dad. My mom is married to some dude in Texas, but he doesn't know anything about raising a daughter. Or maybe he does and he's just too scared to come out and say it. Either way, I don't think my life will be totally messed up if I can somehow manage to meet my biological father before he dies of old age. In the meantime, though, there are plenty of other dads out there who are doing great jobs of it. Like Greg Childs at Smith Rock in Oregon, for instance--or Peter Croft in England, or even Warren Harding in California! (Okay, so maybe not all those guys are total role models.)",0.0,,

3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," What is my dad? Am I adopted? These are all questions that kids ask, and they're questions that adults ask, too. The truth is, we don't know much about our parents' childhoods. Our genetic material came together in a random encounter 100 or more years ago. Since then, they've been living off the interest from our family savings account.",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia," My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to bring home from the bar. The other guys just leave them there, you know, like ""She's with her friend.""",0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She's like Russian or something. She's like a Russian immigrant, so she talks about how your mom used to make you speak Russian when you were little and then you'd be like ""What language is this?"" And now I know what language it is.",0.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably because they were both climbers themselves. They had their own little climbing club, the Arcs de Triomphe.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would pay him to go to these really impoverished countries and live in very basic conditions and evaluate how well these governments were dealing with environmental issues like deforestation or water pollution or things like that. And then based on that report, the World Bank would make policy recommendations about whether they should be investing in those countries or not.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then, you know, the writers that I read were all kind of old-school: Mark Twight, Jim Bridwell, Billy Westbay. You know, classic climbers writing about classic climbing.",1.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of it,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the complexity of the moves, the permanence of the climate. It's just this huge, solemn reminder that you're small and your feet aren't on any good rock. There's no texture to speak of, it's just smooth granite.""",0.85714287,,

11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've always kind of liked the Gossamer Foundation for Accessible Architecture. You know, just a simple idea, but it's so hard to do in practice. The thing is you have to find a really well-traveled path that's used by a lot of people. And then you have to make sure your equipment is up to date and that there's somebody there who can help you with it. And the last thing you want is for someone to get hurt using your gear or having a accident with it.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think for me it was Yosemite. For him, it was the High Sierra. We would always try to go somewhere new. My dad would be like, ""Oh, that's interesting,"" and then he'd write a book about it.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing, or the film-making, or the writing? Or all of them?",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I don't know if I can really tell you the secret to success. But I will say this: it's a combination of things, a lot of which have nothing to do with climbing. For me, personally, it was about setting new goals and challenging myself--both in terms of what I set out to achieve and in the way that I went about achieving it. It's also about finding like-minded people with whom I share those goals and interests, and being inspired by their stories as they triumph over adversity.",0.4,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huber variation on the Eiger, a linkup of some great routes on Cerro Torre and Aguja Poincenot in Patagonia, and finally El Cap.",,0.30078074,0.25492728
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," So, what's the point? I practice free soloing and roped climbing in a gym to get used to controlling my fear.",,0.6127403,0.55167234
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, basically. You know, I think about it less and less each time I do it.",,0.5191078,0.4824641
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, which is kind of a funny way to grow up. He was a climber himself, so we moved around a lot and lived all over the state, but always in the mountains. We had an old Toyota Land Cruiser that we would pack out stuff in. When I was young, my dad would take me rock climbing. Then as I got older and started going to campgrounds and things like that, he would leave before sunup so I could climb by myself before anybody else showed up.",,0.543089,0.6194624
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's just a matter of practice. I've been practicing the moves on El Cap for years and never had the focus to do it safely. Then one day, everything came together perfectly. The weather was perfect, I didn't get distracted, I didn't look down once, and I got up there and did it.",,0.6283023,0.6109486
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different."," Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm doing the right thing, or if I just have blind faith that things will work out?",,0.94965005,0.25713956
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I don't know. I guess if you're going to do a free solo it's kind of like an audition or something, you know. Like are you ready for this? So far i've done all my solos on big walls in the Valley so it doesn't really help me with anything else. But um yeah I mean if i'm ever going to do a free solo outside of the Valley I think that it would be helpful to have some experience with smaller walls and maybe even cliffs.",,0.39604616,0.5287184
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project alone, but I also like the companionship of working with a partner. It all depends on the circumstances and how I'm feeling.",,0.5164155,0.46595705
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, compared to his super intense training regimen and focus on performance it's pretty easy for me. For me, the most important thing is just to live a good life and do good things with other people.",,0.698605,0.52014315
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to somebody. I was scared shitless. I thought I was going to die of fear.",,0.4606712,0.36823368
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it.", How do I keep from getting killed or hurt? These are all fair questions when you're climbing with a partner who is less experienced or less talented than yourself. And they're especially pertinent when the other person is your daughter. Here's how I answer them.,,0.836003,0.41364524
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they deal with the stress of knowing that, on any given day, they could die?",,0.98171556,0.62111706
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I'd say the biggest breakthroughs have come through trial and error. The more I climb, the more I learn about what works and doesn't work. Through years of hard-core free soloing, I've developed a pretty thick skin. Now, when something goes wrong, it really goes wrong. If I'm in serious trouble on a climb, my only option is to find a way out--fast.",,0.6178558,0.6766273
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was, like, 19 or 20 years old. And at that point in my life, there were no pro- climbers that I knew of that were trans. So it was just sort of a personal thing where I felt like I should start the conversation and create some role models for young trans people who might be interested in climbing.",,0.49062157,0.23627597
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked me.,,0.42789915,0.08419425
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're pushing yourself to the limit and doing things that are considered dangerous. And so it kind of feels like a natural extension of what I've already been doing in the gym and on rock.",,0.5134774,0.5919535
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, I think that if you're somebody who is naturally inclined toward risk-taking, then certainly by the age of thirty or so you're going to have learned a lot about how to mitigate and manage your own fear. But at the same time, I do think that there are certain kinds of climbing that would be appropriate for anybody regardless of their level of experience. And so when I go out on big walls, for instance, I'm not afraid, necessarily.",,0.6115669,0.61393714
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to have a really clear idea of what you want. I don't mean just a goal, but an actual plan for how you're going to get there. That's something that I've had to work on in my own life, and it's the reason why I started this podcast was because I felt like there were so many other climbers out there who didn't know what they wanted or how they were going to get it. It's pretty easy when you're young and idealistic to say, ""I want to help cure cancer"" or ""I want to save the rain forest."" Those are nice goals, but are they specific enough? If you don't know exactly how you're going to achieve those goals then it's very hard to make progress.",,0.6341524,0.51273036
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think it's important to remember that any one of those accidents could have happened. You know, like if I was walking down the street and I slipped and fell, then that's not as bad as getting into a car accident or something. But it is true that when you're free soloing, there's always the possibility that you're going to get hit by a bus or something.",,0.69587666,0.44333857
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans are too afraid to admit that they live within the median. But I will say this: If you're in the middle of a rock climbing gym and somebody says, ""Hey, wanna die?"" You'd probably better say yes.",,0.577868,0.35782206
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," Yeah, I mean there was definitely a point in my life where I just felt like I wanted to go as far as I could with climbing.",,0.44276863,0.4184723
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it., I think it would be nice if we could all just take a deep breath and relax.,,0.7183931,0.30832306
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’.

42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not as much as my friends think. I like to think that I drink enough for both of us.",,0.5831225,0.5612715
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away by it, but I think that fear is something that makes you want to do your best. If you're not afraid then there's no reason to think you'll do well, right?",,0.6927827,0.6543545
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you. But if you have to work at being confident, then I think that's something that can be taught and developed.",,0.46125692,0.22146505
