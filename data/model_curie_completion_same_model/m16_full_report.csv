0,FACT,Where did you grow up?,"Sacramento, California"," In Sacramento, California. Both my parents taught English as a Second Language (ESL) at a series of institutions in the United States and abroad. Eventually they landed more permanent jobs at American River College in Sacramento. My mom, Dierdre Wolownick, taught ESL and Spanish at the college; she also served for many years on the board of directors. Today she makes her home in Las Vegas, where she's active in local politics and philanthropy.",1.0,,
1,FACT,Who is your dad?,Charles Hannold," I don't know. I mean, like, that's a tough one. Um. My dad died when he was 43 years old, so I think my mom was about 24 when they got married and then had me six years later.",0.0,,
2,FACT,When is your birthday?,"August 17, 1985"," April 21, 1992.",0.0,,
3,FACT,Who is your mom?,Dierdre Wolownick," What is my dad? What happened to me? Am I dead?"" And then, once you get those questions answered, ""What's next?""",0.0,,
4,FACT,Who is your sister?,Stasia, My sister is the person who can't live without me. She's the one I have to give a shit about.,0.0,,
5,FACT,Which language did your mom talk to you in?,French," She only spoke French to my dad. And then they'd speak English to me because I was an American kid. So I didn't really grow up with a lot of French language, you know, exposure or anything like that. But now that I'm older and I live in France, it's kind of nice to be able to talk about certain things with my mom where we're both sort of on the same page.",1.0,,
6,FACT,At what age did you start climbing?,10 years," I think I was about four or five. My parents took me to a climbing gym when I was very young, probably too young to remember. They were like, ""Oh, here's this kid at the climbing gym that's kind of crazy,"" and then eventually they took me to a real rock wall.",0.0,,
7,FACT,Where did your dad get a permanent job?,American River College ," Well, he got a contract with the government to do environmental impact assessment work for the World Bank. So basically what they would have him do is go to these developing countries and evaluate how well various projects were going to affect the environment.",0.4,,
8,FACT,Whose climbing stories did you read growning up?,Mark Twight," Well, I mean, obviously, John Bachar was a huge influence on me. And then later on, when I started writing about climbing myself, you know, the writers that I most admired were Mark Twight and Peter Croft and Lynn Hill. All three of them are now retired or semi-retired but they're all still writing incredible adventure stories. And those are the climbers that I read as a kid and sort of tried to emulate as a young climber.",1.0,,
9,FACT,What makes El Cap so intimidating?,Scale of the wall," ""The sheer scale of the wall,"" says Tommy Caldwell, ""the fact that it's so much higher than you ever thought possible, the complexity of the moves, and that there are no ropes or gear placements to help you. It takes a long time to get used to climbing without rope or gear, but once you do, it's pretty smooth.""",1.0,,
10,FACT,What is your usual breakfast?,Muesli and fruit," I mean, I don't really have a usual breakfast. I mean, I eat everything.",0.0,,
11,FACT,Which project were you dreaming of for years?,Moonlight Buttress," Well, actually, I've sort of had a bunch of them. The one that I think about the most is something called the Long Now Foundation. It's a project to create a kind of permanent base for humanity in space. You know, like an outpost or something on the moon or on Mars or whatever.",0.0,,
12,FACT,What was the favorite hiking destination for you and your dad?,Mount Tallac," Well, I think the favorite for all of us was Yosemite. We would go every year from 2010 to 2014. So, maybe you could say my love affair with hiking started at age seven or eight, when I went on my very first trip to California's Yosemite National Park with my family.",0.0,,
13,FACT,Who convinced The North Face to sponsor you?,Conrad Anker," Was it the climbing team, or did you sell them some product? Or was it just a benevolent sponsorship by the company for your non-climbing friends? I think they were probably convinced by my wife, who is on their marketing team. She's the one that brought me in to meet with their management.",0.0,,
14,FACT,What keeps you motivated?,Insatiable hunger and curiosity," I think it was the quote I used to use all the time when I was like 25 or 26, which is ""I'm never going to be happy if I'm just sitting on a mountain top thinking about it."" Which is kind of funny because now that i'm actually doing it, I feel pretty happy.",0.0,,
15,INF,Tell me about your book Alone on the Wall. It’s split into seven of your most memorable climbs. What are they?,"They’re all just significant events for me. Starting with some of the early free solos that I did and sort of building in complexity as I started big wall soloing using some ropes and hardware, but mostly climbing by myself."," The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome, the Torre Traverse, the Fitz Traverse, the Huberdihedral Wall in Switzerland, the Piola-Anker in Italy, and finally El Cap. Each one is a classic.",,0.4634414,0.27167365
16,INF,Can you explain the type of climbing you practice? I understand there are no ropes or climbing hardware to keep you safe.,"That’s called free soloing and that is part of what I do, but I mean I’ve been climbing for 20 years and I practice all sorts of climbing. That’s why I wrote the book to sort of show the different types of climbing that do."," I mean, I use a harness and some gear, but that's it. No rope, no hardware. It's all about the technique.",,0.6063113,0.4380489
17,INF,How do you manage that fear?,It’s not like I have to overcome fear in the sense of like suppressing it. If I feel a lot of fear then I can just put something off until I’m better trained. The important thing for me is to differentiate between an appropriate fear – like a fear that I’m in danger – and an irrational fear in my mind. If I’m feeling fear because I’m actually in danger or because there’s a chance that I may fall or chance that I might die then that’s a very helpful warning and I should heed that.”," I mean, you know, I just sort of suppress it, basically. You know, I think about it less and less each time I do it.",,0.5191078,0.4824641
18,INF,This is high stakes climbing. How do you grapple with the worst case scenario – death?,"Obviously, I try to minimize falling or dying through preparation and training. There’s no pressure for me to go soloing so if I’m not feeling totally up for it then I just put it of for later."," I mean, I don't know. I've never thought about it before.",,0.575465,0.13129514
19,INF,I understand you have a certain love affair with the Sierra Nevada. Tell me about that and the climbs you’ve taken there and your history with it.,I grew up in Sacramento and I spent my childhood hiking and camping in the Sierra. The smell of the pine forest there still feels very much like home. Yosemite is in the Sierra Nevada and that’s where I’ve done the majority of my climbing. I think El Capitan is probably the most impressive piece of rock in the world.," I was born in Sacramento, grew up in the Sierra Nevada. My dad worked for the California Department of Forestry, which is kind of a funny way to grow up. He was a climber himself, so we would go climbing all the time. We lived in an old van. I have very vivid memories of going to Red Rocks and other places like that as a kid.",,0.5183761,0.71906805
20,INF,How have you developed the focus required to free solo?,"That’s actually the one aspect of it I don’t need to practice. It’s not that I’m gifted. Free soloing just forces me to focus naturally. It’s a by-product of being on a wall without ropes: You have to perform, so you flip that switch. For me, the preparation lies more in physical training and route planning."," I think it's pretty easy to answer. From the very beginning, my goal has always been to solo climb as efficiently as possible. I've tried to develop techniques that maximize my efficiency, such as using a rope only when absolutely necessary. I also train constantly in order to improve my fitness and minimize the amount of energy I expend while climbing. Basically, I try to do everything right so that I can get more right than wrong during a free solo attempt.",,0.77688515,0.69295454
21,INF,How do you decide which risks are worth taking?,"The casual observer might think free soloing is all crazy and reckless. But you can’t have a long career unless you spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about risk and minimizing it to ensure your own safety. There’s a brief scene in Free Solo where an fMRI shows that the amygdala in my brain responds differently than a “normal” person’s to low levels of fear stimuli, and most viewers come away saying, “There’s something unique about his brain.” I find that slightly irritating, because I’ve spent 25 years conditioning myself to work in extreme conditions, so of course my brain is different—just as the brain of a monk who has spent years meditating or a taxi driver who has memorized all the streets of a city would be different.", Which projects are most in line with my values? Which teammates are worth trusting with a big project? How do I know if I'm being prudent or just being afraid?,,0.9406963,0.38583672
22,INF,Do all your climbs help prepare you for free solos?,"A lot of it—with a rope, with partners, or on easy terrain—is strictly for pleasure and relatively relaxed. But there is value in all the time and mileage on rock, feeling comfortable. It’s hard to sustain the intensity you need to free solo, so I think there’s something to be said for making that effort only when I need to."," I mean, I suppose in some sense every climb is a preparation for free soloing. But I think that the specific challenges of each route are what help to train your body and mind for the ultimate adventure.",,0.5256213,0.70354134
23,INF,“Free solo” implies an individual pursuit. Do you prefer that or collaboration?,"On the whole, climbing is very collaborative. Even during the two years we filmed Free Solo, I did a giant rope linkup with the climbing legend, Tommy Caldwell. I climb with partners all the time. Free soloing is only a few climbs a year."," I think both. I like the challenge of taking on a project that seems hard even for a team, and I like the personal satisfaction of seeing it through to completion. But I also enjoy the comfort of having partners there to catch me if I fall. In 2012, when I did Moonlight Buttress and Half Dome, two climbs that were new to me, it was with a partner in each case--Alex Lowe and James Pearson, respectively. It would have felt weird not to have had a rope or a belayer waiting for me at the top of either climb.",,0.5344107,0.61957854
24,INF,How does your approach for philanthropic work on Honnold Foundation compare to your approach to climbing?,"I tend to take a big problem and break it into smaller parts. With climbing, I take a huge climb that seems like too much, but then I start. I train; I work towards it. I break it apart into pieces, work on the pieces, and then eventually do it. It’s definitely the same mindset. Issues of global poverty or climate change…can seem totally insurmountable, but then when you start to break it into little pieces, you think, “Well, I can do a little bit on this piece.” You may as well start and try. They basically both stem from the idea that you may as well start doing something…though these are obviously very different activities."," I think my approach to climbing and to life in general is much more laid back than Honnold's. I don't know if he'd call it ""laid back"" but, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about the world and what we're doing and where we're going and how we can do things better. And then act on those thoughts when they're ready.",,0.770013,0.5016911
25,INF,"What was it like, the first time you climbed El Capitan?","Completely outrageous. My partner and I had the big goal for the season to climb El Capitan in a day by any means, not free climbing, just doing anything we could to get to the top. We built up for it the whole season. It was a big adventure, a big challenge. We climbed the easiest route in 23 hours. Doing it represented a whole other world of climbing."," I was, like, nine or 10? My dad took me up to Yosemite for my birthday. We drove all day, got there in the evening, and he left me alone in the car while he went into the restaurant to talk to people. I was too young to climb anything but little routes. But I sat in the car all night and looked through the windows at all the climbers going up on El Capitan. It was kind of a life-changing experience.""",,0.40432477,0.4697886
26,INF,How do you manage climbing with someone less experienced or talented?,"In a guiding role, it’s easy: You just take over as team captain and do what needs to be done. The real danger is when two people think they’re climbing as equals but are bringing very different opinions on safety to it."," How do I make the climb safer for others? These are all fair questions, and they're especially pertinent in the case of Tommy, who is less experienced and less talented than I am. The truth is that we've never really talked about any of this stuff. When we go climbing together, it's just two guys on a adventure. We don't talk shop.",,0.5358654,0.45622575
27,INF,Is the way you train—memorizing and rehearsing your plan—typical?,"Visualizing how you’re going to navigate a difficult section is pretty common. Where are my hands going to go? Where should I place my foot? Even recreational climbers in gyms make plans for themselves before they leave the ground. With free soloing, you’re both remembering or anticipating how to do certain climbs and trying to imagine the emotional component. What will it feel like to be up high in a crazy, contorted position without protection during a difficult stretch? When I’m not climbing, I spend most of my time reading books about training, psychology, and performance. If I get one good idea from one book, that’s a success."," Do other climbers train in a similar way? How do they feel about it? I think the general public thinks of climbers as wild-and-crazy types who live to climb, but I hope that by talking about training and preparation I can show that there's a lot more to life than climbing. That said, most professional climbers I know do spend a lot of time memorizing and rehearsing their moves. It's just that some of them are better at hiding it from the public than others!",,0.7600553,0.68876827
28,INF,What has led to the biggest breakthroughs in your climbs?,"There’s a creative element to solving problems, like figuring out how to climb certain sections of wall. But when I’m free soloing, I’ve already prepared and want to stick to the plan. I don’t want to be improvising. That would bring more uncertainty and risk into the equation. So most of my creative processing comes on rest days when I’m lying around somewhere safe, just thinking about climbing. That’s when I’ll envision “enchainments”—combinations of climbs that people have never done before."," I think the answer to that question depends on whether you ask what has led to my ""biggest failures"" or ""most crushing defeats."" In some sense, they're both just synonyms for ""lowest point in my life,"" which is certainly not a phrase I ever want to hear applied to myself. But when you look at it from a purely objective perspective, there have been plenty of low points along the way--especially during my countless free solo attempts.",,0.76789874,0.34683532
29,INF,Why did you establish Hannold Foundation?,"I had an obligation to do something for others, for those with fewer choices in life and fewer means to accomplish them. By 2012, thanks to sponsorship and commercials, I had more money than I needed to live comfortably. So I established the Honnold Foundation. Its motto is ""Helping people live better, simply."" The mission statement I posted on my new website read, ""The Honnold Foundation seeks simple, sustainable ways to improve lives world-wide. Simplicity is the key; low-impact, better living is the goal."""," Well, I started climbing when I was like 19 or 20, and I was really serious about it for a few years. And then eventually, as you do with any hobby, you start to get into other things. You know, sort of branch off into other interests. And so in the early days of my climbing, before I established Hannold Foundation, I did a lot of work with nonprofits. Like environmental stuff and things like that. But then over time as my career developed and things have shifted focus slightly towards climate change advocacy and all that kind of stuff around climate change mitigation and adaptation.",,0.48361567,0.40689608
30,ABS,"Why can’t you take fewer risks, even if just for Sanni?","For Sanni, the point of life is happiness and to have a good time. For me, it’s all about performance. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. Nobody achieves anything great because they’re happy and cosy. This is your path and you will pursue it with excellence. You face your fear because your goal demands it, that is the goddamn warrior spirit. You give something 100 percent focus because your life depends on it.", she once asked.,,0.22021735,0.048222497
31,ABS,Is there a place you go when you go to inside of you when you’re free soloing that’s different then when you’re out with ropes and bolts on a rock?,It’s definitely more of something. I guess it takes me to a different place. It just requires a higher level of focus.," I mean, do you have a favorite place to go when you’re by yourself?",,0.8013353,0.18164785
32,ABS,"Since death is a big part of the way people interpret what you do, what scares you about life?","Intimacy, connection, relationships. Or you are wasting time, squandering it. I mean in some ways living with regret that you didn’t do the right thing or you could have done something better."," I'm afraid that I'll get in a car accident, that I'll have a heart attack, that I'll fall off a cliff. You know, the normal things that everybody fears.",,0.67111933,0.20957358
33,ABS,"What are your thoughts about fate, given what you do? Many people would look at what you do and have a sense that you're right on the edge between life and death.",I would hope that they're wrong about that! But who knows? I've never been religious or spiritual in any way. I'm not a big subscriber to fate. I see life as probabilities and chance and reality. Fate doesn't play into my thinking at all. But I definitely do think about mortality and my time being short. I'm very aware that I have a limited time here and I should make the most of it and do what I can. I think that the desire to do my best in climbing does stem in part from knowing that I'll only be here for a certain amount of time., That's certainly what I get a sense of when I'm on theedge.,,0.14682187,0.32971826
34,ABS,You compare free soloing to warrior culture. Can you tell me about that analogy and how it occurred to you?,"That particular quote about warrior culture came from Morocco, where I went climbing with Tommy. When I was on that trip, I binge-watched four seasons of a show called Spartacus, which is about gladiator violence in Ancient Rome. It’s perfect mindless action television to get you fired up for hard climbing. It made me think of all my climbing like…being in the ring, rising to the occasion, and performing. I was in a total gladiator mode, which is honestly a good mindset for free soloing.

I definitely wouldn’t say that I think of myself as a warrior or anything like that, but I do think the quote is used fairly in the film. It’s just slightly embarrassing for me to hear now because it seems over the top."," Well, I think that in many ways climbing has been like a warrior culture for me. You know, because you're putting your life on the line every time you climb. And so it makes sense that when I started writing about climbing, and talking about it publicly, you know, people were like oh he's going to get killed or he's gonna kill himself. And now look at all the stuff that I've done.",,0.46936032,0.58449113
35,ABS,"I think it's fair to say that you do things that many people would not do because they would be stopped by fear. What is the difference there? Is it that you've learned to manage fear, or something innate?","Part of that is that I've spent so much time being afraid. I have a lot of experience with fear, probably more than the average person. And I think that allows me to help differentiate when I'm truly in danger and when I should act on it "" whether or not this fear that I'm feeling is important or not."," I think it's probably some of both. I mean, certainly there are plenty of things that I do in climbing that most people would consider dangerous or even suicidal. But then, on the other hand, I've also done a lot of things that most people would consider completely safe. So which is it going to be? Is this podcast going to be recorded in an open space with no walls or floor?",,0.6433556,0.35417718
36,ABS,Could you apply some of the skills you’ve developed as a climber to figure out the next stage of your life?,"It’s clichéd, but I do think climbing teaches you goal setting, work ethic, and perseverance. The majority of the time you spend sport climbing, you’re failing: falling off and then trying to figure out how not to fall. Climbing reminds you that to get better at anything, you’ve got to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and keep beating your head against a wall to figure it out. So I guess my advice to myself would be to “keep moving.” I started the Honnold Foundation, which gives grants to advance solar energy around the world, because I wanted a positive outlet for the material rewards that were coming in from the film and doing commercials. Otherwise there’s no benefit to being famous. At least now I’m funneling a significant portion of my income to cause that matter. We’ll be giving away a million dollars in grants this year."," I think the most important thing is to have a really clear idea of what you want. I don't think I could define with precision what my next steps should be, but I do know that I want to keep moving forward.",,0.67737454,0.3082794
37,ABS,"Do you try to sustain a sense of your life’s fragility when you’re not 3,000 feet in the air?","Actually, I would say that the feeling of free soloing is not relishing the feeling of mortality or death. It’s relishing the feeling of taking something that seems like it should be scary or dangerous and making it feel comfortable or safe. The real joy in soloing is to do something that should make you think you’re going to die, but then actually be totally comfortable and know that you’re not going to die. The pursuit of mastery, the work that you’re doing when soloing, is to make you feel comfortable."," I mean, I think about it all the time.",,0.75546765,0.13910484
38,ABS,"Would you admit that most humans in pockets of society live within a status quo, that we live within the median, we don’t take enough risks?","I mean by definition most people live within the average, it makes sense because we’re hardwired to seek out comfort and stability and enjoy our lives, there’s nothing wrong with that. I think that the whole spectrum of human activity makes sense. It makes sense for most people in the middle, even for me, I’m sure I’m just like a standard deviation out to one part of the other."," No, I would not admit that. Most humans in pockets of society do take enough risks. It's just that the kind of climbing I'm doing now is so much more dangerous than what most people are doing in their daily lives.",,0.5721879,0.43095958
39,ABS,Did you feel like you got addicted to climbing that you just wanted to explore it further at a certain point?,"I think it’s just the activity that gives me the most joy in life. In some ways, some people love to go running or swimming. There’s a certain elemental or base appeal to the activity."," I mean, I think that you can get addicted to just about anything. But yeah, I mean at a certain point you just kind of know what you want and how to get it and you're like ""I don't really see why i'd change this,"" you know.",,0.35010007,0.3434881
40,ABS,Don’t you think it would benefit all of us to embrace the irrational a bit more or not to be so risk-averse in a way?,I think that on any given day everybody is confronting risk and there’s always a degree of randomness. Everybody is facing death each day. We just put it out of our minds and never think about it.," I think that it would be nice to have a bit more of an emotional life, you know. To feel a little bit more passionate about something.",,0.5208752,0.27132052
41,ABS,"Has your relationship with nature changed? I mean you’ve built a very close bond throughout your life with nature. Up close and personal, more than a lot of us so how would you define your relationship with nature in a way.","That’s an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it. I mean in some ways I’d say that I don’t see a huge difference between nature and non-nature.  It’s all just part of the same world. I feel comfortable in the outdoors and in the bush. Typically if you’re raised in a city or the suburbs you think of nature as something else, you are like, ‘oh those wild spaces, that seems dangerous’. But I don’t feel that way anymore."," That everyone will understand, I think. I mean you know, like when you hear the word bond it sounds kind of corny but i really do feel that way. Like a close personal bond with nature and being out in the wilds and all that sort of thing.",,0.2600663,0.5520597
42,ABS,Why dont you like to drink?,"I’ve never done drugs, and though I’ve tasted alcohol, I’ve never had a whole drink. I don’t even drink coffee. I had a small cup once—it was like drinking battery acid. I had to poop all morning. I once had a sniff of Scotch. I thought, I should be cleaning my sink with this stuff. It’s not some moral objection—drugs and booze and caffeine just have no appeal to me."," I mean, I do, but not to the extent that people think. I like to drink socially. I don't like to drink when I'm performing.",,0.63834167,0.6383147
43,ABS,What are your thougts about fear during climbing?,"Fear. It’s the most primal element in cutting-edge climbing, or indeed, in adventure of any kind. Even nonclimbers can recognize that fact, when they watch footage of me free soloing. That’s why the first question out of their mouths is usually, “Aren’t you afraid . . . ?” (They don’t have to finish the sentence—“that you’re going to die?”)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me, the crucial question is not how to climb without fear—that’s impossible—but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.
"," I think that fear is a good thing. I don't think that you should let yourself get carried away by it, but I think that it's important to recognise when you're afraid and why you're afraid and then to deal with it.",,0.6633581,0.61507344
44,ABS,Where does confidence and self-belief come from?,"I see it all rooted in rationalism, in a basic evaluation of objective reality: Can I do this? And if I can, then I just do it. If I've done something on a rope over and over and over, then obviously I can physically do it, so there's no real reason why I shouldn't be able to do it without the rope."," I think it's from within, you know. I think that if you're naturally a confident person, then you probably just feel very comfortable in your own skin, and so it comes quite naturally to you. But if you have to work at being confident, then I don't know, it's hard to describe but if you watch some of my climbing footage where obviously I'm like spouting off all over the place and being really arrogant, that's not natural for me either.",,0.4596621,0.38002467
