You’ve just arrived, so you’re probably tired from the trip. If you don’t feel like leaving the hotel, don’t push it. It’s best to rest because you’ll need energy for the week ahead. If it’s too early or you feel like going out for a drink, ask the hotel if there’s an interesting bar or pub around or, if you’re in an exciting neighborhood, take a walk to explore it.\\nFirst Day in London\\nCity of London during sunrise\\nIn the morning\\nStart at the City of London, also known as the Square Mile, the heart of the city. Start your day with a short 2-kilometer walk through the City’s main attractions and historical landmarks.\\nFirst, the Museum of London where you’ll get to know more about London’s turbulent History, from the Romans to the Saxons and the Middle Ages. It’s located in the roundabout between London Wall and Aldersgate St. and, like in most museums in London, the entrance is free.\\nThen walk for about 5 minutes towards the Thames and visit St. Paul’s Cathedral, an Anglican Cathedral that’s one of the most impressive in the world. Its dome is the second largest in the world, only surpassed by St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican.\\nSt. Paul’s Cathedral in London\\nUnless you rushed through it, it should be lunch time by now. Look for the Burger and Lobster less than 5-minute walking distance from where you are, on Broad St. It’s not very expensive for this part of town, and you can have a simple meal for a little more than 10 Euros.\\nThere are plenty of restaurants in the area, so you can take some time until you find one you like.\\nAfter Lunch\\nAfter lunch, I suggest something that will definitely help you burn some calories. Go down a few meters towards the river to Cannon St. and walk for about 1 km until you reach The Monument, a memorial of the Great Fire of London.\\nBe brave and climb the 311 steps to the top. The ticket costs about 5 Euros, but the view from the top is worth it. After catching your breath, walk for 10 minutes towards the Tower of London and Crown Jewels Exhibition.\\nTower of London\\nOn the shores of the Thames River, this massive structure was built in the 11th century by order of William the Conqueror and has had several uses from the monarch’s residence to the prison of the kingdom’s destitute.\\nCurrently, it houses the crown jewels and a colony of six ravens protected by Royal decree that, according to popular belief, protect the Tower and the British Crown.\\nTower Bridge\\nNext, walk across the adjacent Tower Bridge, also one of the most impressive structures of the city.\\nIn the evening\\nIf you still have the energy, walk 45 minutes to the London Eye (alternatively you can catch a bus) and buy a ticket for one of the giant wheel’s rides for a spectacular view of the city. Enjoy fast-track admission and avoid queuing here.\\nLondon Eye\\nIf you’re not a fan of giant wheels and would rather spend the 25 euros of the ticket on a nice dinner or a night out, go straight to The Shard, the tallest building in London. You can dine at one of its top restaurants (they’re top both in quality and in height) while enjoying a fabulous view over London. Get the View from the Shard Entrance Ticket.\\nThese restaurants are expensive, so if you want to save money, you can grab a bite on the street and then go up to The Shard for a drink at sunset. The highest bar and restaurant is Gong on the 52nd floor.\\nIt doesn’t sound like it when reading this, but by now you’ve walked and seen a lot.\\nEnjoy the view and unless you have more energy to spare, call it a day. There’s more to do tomorrow!\\nHow to get back to the hotel? There are a few ways to get from London Eye to London Bridge. The cheapest way is by bus, with line 381 – 2€ and takes about 16 minutes. The quickest way to get is to take a taxi – 8€ – 11€ and takes about 5 minutes. If you decided to go to The Shard, you can walk back to your hotel.\\nSecond Day in London\\nIn the morning\\nOn Sunday, especially if you’re traveling in the spring or summer, spend some time at one of the many parks in the city.\\nWhen the weather is nice, there are always lots of people enjoying the sun and lots of outdoor activities. Start the day with a visit to Tate Modern, England’s contemporary art gallery that’s open every day from 10:00 am.\\nUnless you want to visit a special exhibition, the entrance is free. It’s on Southwark, next to the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian bridge that connects Bankside to the City of London.\\nMillennium Bridge and St. Paul’s Cathedral\\nInside Tate Modern\\nOn your way out, look for a supermarket or a street market where you can buy some groceries for a picnic at one of the parks in the city.\\nI suggest St. James’ Park, about 30 minutes walking distance from Tate Modern. Follow the lead of Londoners and relax while soaking up the sun.\\nNext, or if the weather isn’t that great, go see the Buckingham Palace (or visit inside if it’s open) located between the Green Park and the Buckingham Palace Gardens.\\nIn the evening\\nFor dinner, look for The Market Tavern five minutes walking distance from the palace on Shepherd Street, where you can have a reasonably affordable meal and one of the many beers available if you order from one of the snack menus starting at 5 pounds. Book a table in the main pub area.\\nWestminster Palace\\nIf you still have the energy and it’s not too late in the evening, go down towards the Thames and walk for a while on the Millbank until you reach the Westminster Palace. Weather permitting, you’ll see many people walking alongside the river.\\nHow to get back to the hotel? There are a few ways to get from Buckingham Palace to London Bridge. The cheapest way is by subway – 5€ – 6€ and takes about 15 minutes. The quickest way is to take a taxi – 12€ – 15€ and takes about 7 minutes.\\nThird Day in London\\nCamden Market\\nIn the morning\\nStart the day with a short 3-kilometer boat trip from Westminster to Greenwich. After that go to Camden Market, one of the best-known markets in London where you can not only have a cheap meal, but buy vintage clothes, vinyl records, antiques, and many more things.\\nTransportation? There are many ways to get from Greenwich to Camden Town. The cheapest way is by bus – 2€ and takes about 47 minutes. The quickest way is to take a taxi – 28€ – 35€ and takes about 22 minutes. There is a hourly direct train departing from Maze Hill and arriving at London St Pancras and takes about 28 minutes.\\nIn the afternoon, walk across Regent’s Park (about a 30-minute walk) and go to Madame Tussauds, the wax museum that’s also one of the main tourist attractions in the city. It’s so famous it has several franchises all over the world. Buy the ticket to Madame Tussauds here.\\nIf you’re a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective books, visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum on Baker Street, less than 5 minutes walking distance from Tussauds. The ticket costs 15 Pounds (about 20 Euros). Get a Sherlock Holmes 4-Hour Private Guided Tour.\\nIn the evening\\nWhether you travel alone or with friends, don’t skip attending one of the many musicals in London. I suggest Wicked, at the Apollo Victoria Theater, a parody inspired by the Wizard of Oz. Get Wicked show tickets online.\\nApollo Victoria Theatre\\nBefore the musical, look for a restaurant serving pre-theater meals. Not only you can have dinner in time for the theater play before 7:30 pm, you’ll usually get a discount by showing your ticket.\\nI suggest Opera Tavern, a tapas place on Catherine Street where you can snack for a little more than 5 Euros or have a full meal for 20. It’s one kilometer from the Apollo Victoria Theatre at Covent Garden.\\nHow to get back to the hotel? There are a few ways to get from Apollo Victoria Theatre to London Bridge. The cheapest way is by subway – 5€ – 6€ and takes about 25 minutes. The quickest way is to take a taxi – 13€ – 17€ and takes about 8 minutes.\\nFourth Day in London\\nOxford Circus\\nIn the morning\\nDon’t lose track of time or else you won’t be able to do anything else today.\\nDon’t leave your last-minute shopping for last. Start your day with a quick trip to Oxford Circus, Europe’s busiest commercial area, for some shopping.\\nWith over 300 shops on Oxford Street, Regent Street, and the many side streets, I’m sure you’ll find what you’re looking for.\\nWhen you start to feel peckish, look for a fish-and-chips restaurant or a fast food joint, so you don’t waste time.\\nWestminster Palace\\nAfter lunch, visit the Westminster Palace within 20 minutes walking distance from Regent Street and take a guided tour of the palace, which is also the headquarters of the British Parliament.\\nIt costs 25 pounds, but if you don’t want to spend the money, you can still see the exterior and visit the areas open to the public, which is still worthwhile.\\nBig Ben in London\\nLook at the famous Clock Tower, now officially called Elizabeth Tower, and wait for Big Ben’s ring at the hour.\\nDon’t forget to visit Westminster Abbey right next door, on the other side of Abingdon Street, the most important church of London and England where British monarchs are crowned. Get your London Westminster Abbey Entrance Ticket & Audio Guide online.\\nIn the evening\\nCovent Garden\\nIn the evening, look for The Lamb and Flag at Covent Garden to have dinner. It’s one of the oldest and most charismatic pubs in London where, in addition to cheap meals around 10 to 15 Euros, you’ll find a great diversity of beers and whiskeys.\\nIf it’s not too late when you finish eating, take a walk in Covent Garden before heading back to the hotel.\\nHow to get back to the hotel? There are a few ways to get from Covent Garden to London Bridge. The cheapest way is by bus, with line 381 – 2€ and takes about 12 minutes. Also on the budget is by subway – 4€ – 6€ and takes about 3 minutes. The quickest way to get is to take a taxi – 4€ – 6€ and takes about 2 minutes.\\nFifth Day in London\\nGreenwich Market\\nIn the morning\\nVisit the Greenwich Market dedicated to arts, antiques, and handicrafts. It’s one of the most charismatic markets in London, in a building classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Take your time to visit.\\nAfter visiting Greenwich Market you should try to get some lunch in the area. After lunch search for the National Maritime Museum, about 300 meters from the market. The Royal Observatory, also in the same neighborhood will be the last place you will visit in the neighborhood. Get Royal Observatory and Cutty Sark Tickets.\\nIn the afternoon\\nAt the end of the day, catch the subway or get a taxi to the City of London, and look for the Ye Olde Mitre Tavern. It’s a true hidden gem of London and probably the most difficult tavern to find in the city, in a narrow alley. It’s on 1 Ely Court, Ely Place, London. Phone: +44 20 7405 4751.\\nTransportation? There are many ways to get from King’s Observatory to Ye Olde Mitre. London Underground takes around 38 minutes and departs every 15 minutes. Tickets cost 5€ – 7€. Taking a taxi takes around 23 minutes and costs 30€ – 40€.\\nGoing back home?\\nLast morning: There is not much left to do, and you still have a long way to go to catch your flight. The best option is to pack and travel to the airport, by car or by train, with enough time available to avoid mishaps.\\nOptions to the airport\\nPrivate transfer from Central London to Heathrow Airport – 40 Euros.\\nHeathrow Express train ticket – 25 Euros.\\nBus Transfer between Heathrow and Gatwick Airports – 31 Euros.\\nVisit Bath and the Stonehenge\\nStonehenge\\nIn the morning\\nFor this last full day in England, I suggest a day trip to the beautiful city of Bath, famous for its baths and hot springs. It’s about 150 km west of London, a two-hour train ride away. If you’re not afraid to drive on the “wrong” side of the road, rent a car to get around more freely.\\nBath\\nWhen in Bath, don’t forget to visit the Roman Baths. Try to travel as early as possible to avoid the crowds that typically arrive around lunchtime. For lunch, look for Chapel Arts Café, a restaurant/café with different vegetarian options and affordable. If you have the time, take one of the free walking tours guided by volunteers, who show you all the city’s main attractions in about two hours.\\nWhile driving to Bath, you can take a detour to world-famous Stonehenge, the Bronze Age megalith monument that it’s believed to be connected with astronomy and religious practices. You can also take a day-tour from London to visit Bath and the Stonehenge.\\nIn the evening\\nFor dinner, look for Casanis, a very cozy restaurant in the city center. A meal costs around 20 to 30 Euros per person, but it’s worth it for the atmosphere and the quality of the food.\\nSpend the night at one of the gorgeous hotels in Bath to relax before your returning trip. Accommodation is cheaper here than in London, and you can stay at a double room at a great hotel like Aqua Sulis or Bay Tree House for less than 150 Euros.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nBrazilian Amazon River by Boat\\nTraveling the Amazon River by boat is an amazing experience. Cruising for days on this epic journey is something that will stay in your memory forever.\\nOn this page, I will give you some useful suggestions and directions to help you cross the Brazilian Amazon River by boat more easily and comfortably.\\nMy trip to the Amazon River was always upstream. I made the journey from Macapá to the tri-border of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Yet, I kept on going up the river to the city of Iquitos on the Peruvian side of the Amazon and later on until El Coca in Ecuador through Napo River.\\nThe travel tips I gathered on this page come from an experience of a total of 550 hours of boat travel in Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador, but it refers only to the Brazilian ships.\\nBenjamin Constant boat terminal\\nMy boat trips, Amazon River – Brazil\\nBoat CORAMAR II ● Macapá (Santana) to Monte Alegre – small boat, slow, sleeping in a hammock, free food. 35-hour trip. Price R$120 reais;\\nSpeedboat Tapajós III ● Monte Alegre to Santarém – fast boat, seats, TV. 4-hour trip. Price R$40 reais;\\nBoat Luiz Afonso ● Santarém to Óbidos – medium boat, slow, sleeping in a hammock, food R$10 a meal. 7-hour trip. Price R$30 reais;\\nSpeedboat Tapajós ● Óbidos to Oriximiná – fast boat, seats, TV. 1-hour trip. Price R$20 reais;\\nBoat Cidade Oriximiná II ● Oriximiná to Manaus – big boat, sleeping in a hammock, free food. 36-hour trip. Price R$100 reais;\\nBoat Manoel Monteiro ● Manaus to Benjamin Constant – medium boat, sleeping in a hammock, free food. 156 hours trip. Price R$320 reais;\\nJungle Speed Boat ● Benjamin Constant to Tabatinga – fast boat, seats. 30-minute trip. Price R$20 reais.\\nHow to choose a boat\\nBoats in Santarém port, Brazil\\nThere are large, medium and small boats.\\nThe big ships transport up to 300 people. Medium ships carry up to 200 people, and small boats transport up to 100 people. Speedboats have a maximum of 60 seats and take much less time than slower boats.\\nGenerally, the crew and boat service in medium and large vessels are better.\\nThere are boats made of metal, wood, and speedboats. Smaller wooden boats are slower. Metal boats are stronger and cross the river much faster.\\nDo not travel on a vessel called Cisne Branco. This ship had an accident and killed more than 80 people. It was recently renovated and roams the Amazon River again.\\nThe toilets/bathrooms onboard the boats are always shared, and always separate for women and men. These bathrooms always have toilet and shower in the same compartment.\\nThe areas for hand washing are usually outside the bathroom. These places are more or less always maintained and cleaned by the crew, so they never get filthy to the point you can not use them. They are always relatively clean.\\nThe five-star boat hotel Iberostar does not operate during the winter Brazilian months.\\nIf you’re short on time to travel you can always do the whole route by speedboats. It takes much less time but it is more expensive, and you don’t see anything because you will be in a closed cabin. The boat from Manaus to Benjamin Constant (after Tabatinga) takes 156 hours by slow boat, but with the speedboat, it only takes about 30 hours.\\nHow to choose an Itinerary\\nHouse in the Amazon River\\nUp the river, you see more of the Amazon River banks and the day-to-day life that takes place there.\\nDown the river, you see less of the shore. The boats quickly cruise in the middle of the river at a much higher speed.\\nRemember that down the Amazon River it always takes much less time than going upstream, for the simple reason that boats follow the natural current to gain time and save fuel. The boat from Manaus to Santarém, for example, takes about one day and a half, while the same route, but in reverse, from Santarém to Manaus, takes 3 and a half days.\\nThe river from Belém to Manaus is called Amazon. The river from Manaus to the border with Peru is called Rio Solimões.\\nThe river heading inside Peru is called Amazon again.\\nYou can divide your trip in different itineraries so that you can see and visit various cities along the Amazon River. Places of interest are Macapá, Monte Alegre, Santarém, Alter do Chão, and Óbidos, for example.\\nThe Macapá route to Santarém goes along areas of very narrow river passages, giving a very close view of the shore, people, villages, jungle, animals, etc..\\nThe meeting point of waters arriving and departing from Manaus and Santarém is quite beautiful. Manaus is the meeting place of the Rio Negro and Rio Solimões. Santarém is the meeting place of the Amazon River and the Rio Tapajós.\\nThe Manaus to Tabatinga route is done in an area with lots of white sandy beaches. Jungle and beach together turn out to be a very beautiful scenery.\\nHow to buy a boat ticket\\nBuying my Amazon Riverboat ticket\\nThe high season in the Amazon River is during the European / American winter months and during the Brazilian summer months.\\nMany boats that go up and down the river. Every day and every hour. The idea that you need to book in advance through a travel agency is wrong. You can always buy the tickets directly at the port or inside the boat, at a lower price.\\nDuring high season, there is a greater influx of people traveling by cruise, and thus increasing the number of travelers. You can still buy your ticket, but you’d rather buy it for 1 or 2 days in advance. Anyway, if you arrive at the last minute they will probably always fit one more.\\nDuring the low season, you can buy the ticket on the same departure day, directly on the boat, or newsstand sales of tickets in the harbor entrance like in Manaus.\\nYou can always negotiate the price of the ticket. Even if there is a fixed price, you can always get cheaper (but not during high season).\\nIn the port of Santana (near Macapá), buy your ticket directly on the boat, and do not talk to anyone at the harbor entrance because they will charge more and keep the rest of the money for themselves.\\nThere are electrical outlets on board. Some boats even have them near the hammocks.\\nWhen you buy the ticket on the boat, or when you check-in, you are usually given a small bracelet with a particular color of destination where you go and with the boat’s name. So the crew knows exactly what you paid for, and the city where you go out.\\nWhat to bring onboard\\nWhat to bring to travel in the Amazon\\nHammock and rope.\\nThere is no luggage limit to bring on board. If you have a lot of things you can always hire a porter to help you.\\nYou can buy groceries before boarding or during stops in other cities. There are always lots of people selling cookies, sweets, fried pastries and fruit along the way. There’s even a small selection of things on the boat’s shop.\\nThe boats offer free drinkable water, you can always fill your bottle whenever you want. There is also toilet paper in the bathrooms.\\nYou can bring earplugs. And you’ll be able to sleep better without the engine noise, people, noisy children and cold wind in your ears.\\nOvernight trips sleeping in hammocks are always freezing. Buy a blanket in the city where your trip begins. And throw it away or give it to someone else at the end of your adventure in the Amazon. I bought a blanket of 2m x 1.8m for R$12. I still have it with me.\\nA small plastic box and fork or spoon, so that you can get your food during meal times, and bring it along near your luggage. Most of the passengers do this as well. Also, no need to eat it all at once, you can always eat the rest in an hour or two.\\nA plastic bottle. To fill with water provided free of charge onboard the boat.\\nBring slippers. Much more comfortable to walk in the boat, and to use in the shower and when you go to the toilet.\\nHeadphones and smartphones. You can listen to your favorite music during some parts of the trip while laying down in your hammock.\\nIn some areas of the route, several children are waiting for the boats to pass by to receive a packet of biscuits. Passengers usually buy sweets, bread, crackers, and toys, and put them inside a plastic bag and throw it in the river. These children will come to pick it up.\\nAlways good to have a locker with code. Very useful to be able to keep your backpack closed. You can even tight your bag to a pillar using another padlock.\\nWhere to put your hammock\\nAmazon River in Brazil by boat\\nTo sleep in the hammock, arrive early to the boat, to be able to choose a better place. You can even come in the previous day, put your hammock and return the next day. You can even sleep that night on the boat, ensuring the best place and also saving you money on a hotel night.\\nThere are boats with two or three floors for hammock placement. The best seats are in the upper deck. Never stand on the lower deck or exit and entry of personnel. Because of the engine noise and it’s always very busy. Large boats have the middle deck with air conditioning and sealed windows, so they are very cold areas. Personally, I don’t like it.\\nPay attention if your itinerary is made with the Sun on the left or right side of the boat. You can ask this to the crew. In the Oriximiná trip to Manaus for example, a young crewman gave me a hint not to travel on the right side of the boat because the Sun would pick up throughout the day. Later in the trip, I reported that in my part of the boat was less sunny, and consequently much cooler.\\nIf you choose a place near the light bulbs, you will always have light in your eyes at night, and some parts of the trip will have many insects. Yet these places may have a socket for you to charge your cell phone or computer.\\nAlways keep your hammock away from the stairs, away from the TV, away from the toilets, away from sinks.\\nAlways choose a place near one of the pillars of the boat so that you can tight your backpack. Another advantage is that you will always have more space since you do not have someone close to you because the pillar is between you and that person.\\nThere are many people who use the computer while sitting in the hammock. This page you are reading now was written while sitting in my hammock, on the third day from Manaus to Tabatinga.\\nWhat to see and what to do\\nMeeting of waters of the Amazon and Tapajós rivers\\nUp the river, you will always be near the shore, and you can enjoy small towns, isolated houses, plantations. Downstream, the boat always goes in the middle of the river, far from the shore and you will only see the horizon line and the margin far away.\\nOn two occasions you can contemplate the natural meeting of different colors of river waters. Near Santarém and Manaus. The first half-hour out of these two cities you will have the opportunity to enjoy this phenomenon of Nature.\\nDuring the night, the boats have to use a powerful searchlight, in order to see if there is something dangerous or logs in the river. Enjoy, and during a few hours at night, you can spot the bright eyes of alligators. Very nice indeed, when the light hits the alligator’s eyes, they shine. There are areas along the river with hundreds of alligators.\\nRead a book. You will have plenty of time without anything to do. It’s just you, the boat and the river. Make the most of your time to read the book you’ve always wanted to read.\\nEnjoy the rising and setting of the sun on the Amazon River or Rio Solimões. It’s a beautiful moment you will remember forever. The calmness of the Amazon jungle in the morning is breathtaking. Without a doubt a different morning. During sunset, the lovely colors of the sky will “paint” magnificent sceneries.\\nMeet the captain of the boat. Go slowly and humbly make conversation with who pilots the ship. Ask questions about the river and the boat, which normally all captains answer quite nicely.\\nWrite articles for your travel blog. You will have many hours in your hammock to be able to sit and write.\\nAt night, you can watch soap operas on the boat’s TV on the upper deck. This is where most passengers will sit quietly and silently for 1 hour and a half.\\nHealth and Safety\\nSafety on board of Amazon Riverboats\\nIf you suffer from motion sickness bring some pills with you. You can buy them at a pharmacy before boarding. The river is very stable without significant fluctuations. But there are areas where the river is very busy, and when the boat picks up waves from other vessels things can get rough.\\nIn some parts of the journey up the river, there are a few mosquitoes. When the boat goes very close to the shore and during sunset use long clothes and put repellent cream, or insects spray.\\nNever leave your bag open or valuables on display. If you travel alone try not to show things of value and then go away to eat or have a shower and leave your backpack alone and open. Always use your own padlock.\\nIn my case, we were two people. One always took care of things. Of course, leaving it for 5 minutes will in most cases be OK. The problem is when the boat stops and people from the outside come on board to sell things.\\nIf you arrive at your destination in the evening, you can stay on the boat in your hammock until the next morning. No need to go out at night without knowing where to go. Sleep in your hammock one last night.\\nDuring stops in small towns, there is always time to go out and buy something that you need or do a quick visit. Stops can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Be careful because sometimes the boat can unexpectedly leave. I have a friend whose boat left without him in Tefé, on the route from Manaus to Tabatinga. Always ask the crew about the departure times, and never rely on information that other passengers might say.\\nMedium and large cruises have a nurse on board.\\nEvery morning you can make a bit of exercise on board. It’s good to stretch after sleeping on the hammock. Stretch the spine gripping the metal girders of the boat, where you tight the hammock. You can spin your arms and rotate your hips as well.\\nFood and Snacks\\nAmazon Riverboat Dining Hall\\nSome boats charge for food. These food boxes are called “marmitex” and can cost from R$10 to R$15 reais. As a major criterion for choosing a boat, personally, I always wanted to get food included in the ticket price.\\nThe meals onboard are always very early. Breakfast around 5 or 6 am, lunch around 11:30 am or 12 pm, and dinner around 5 and 6 pm.\\nThe boats that serve food included in the price, usually offer buffet meals. You can eat whatever you want.\\nThe menu ranges from beef stew, roast chicken, pasta, white rice, baked beans, soup or even fish stew.\\nBreakfast varies from boat to boat as well. Some boats only serve porridge, and others serve bread with cheese and coffee with milk. Others offer a greater choice of various fruits, cheese, bread, butter, crackers, fruit juice, and coffee with milk.\\nSome boats have light snacks onboard, which you can buy at the bar, located on the upper deck of the vessel. They have sandwiches, soft drinks, slices of cake and even hamburgers with eggs.\\nSome boats sell beer on board, except the ships owned by evangelical people.\\nIf you are vegetarian, you can try talking to the kitchen to get beans without meat, but, in most cases, the best thing is to bring food from outside. Anyway, there is always white rice and noodles to eat. Bring fruit. Some boats do serve meatless beans.\\nWant to make a cocktail juice while traveling in the Amazon River? Do as I do: buy a liter of pineapple juice, a bottle of coconut milk and a packet of grated coconut. Put everything inside an empty plastic bottle, pour some water and shake well for the mix. And there you go, you enjoy your own Piña Colada in the Amazon!\\nHow to save $150 dollars\\nArriving at Manaus in Brazil, Amazon River by Boat\\nTraveling on a low budget is, for many, the preferred way to know the world.\\nAs a matter of fact, investing a lot of money on traveling doesn’t mean you will enjoy your adventure more or even that you won’t. It all depends on one’s personality and way of experiencing things.\\nTraveling by boat in the Amazon River without spending too much has a significant advantage, which is to travel in the open-air – sleeping in a hammock. Observing the changing landscape, talking to the neighbor in the hammock beside and, above all, seeing how the average Brazilian travels, considering that only a few can afford a private cabin.\\nIn the following lines, I will explain how you can save money traveling by boat in the Amazon River. So, let me give you some very interesting tips that can help you save up to or even more than R$450 / 150 dollars.\\n1- Don’t buy tickets in a travel agency\\nBuy tickets on the same day of departure and always on the boat itself or the harbor. Travel agencies in the city always sell with a margin of R$10 or R$20 on top of the base price. However, there are some harbors where you cannot buy tickets inside the boat and cannot even get into the harbor without previously having a ticket. In these cases get them in the small shops outside and ask around to find the best value for money. For your reference, some cities where you have to buy the ticket outside the harbor are Santarém and Óbidos.\\n2- Buy the tickets directly on the boat\\nAt some harbors, some boys are willing to escort you, saying that they work in the boat or using other excuses. Do not listen to them, go straight to the boat and ask for the person in charge. I saw a lot of people listening to the boys and ending up paying much more than they had to in the Santana harbor (it was the only place I saw this happen). A man was charged with an extra R$20 per person, for a total of three people, totalizing an extra R$60.\\n3- Choose the slow-moving boats\\nIn the Amazon, there are slow and fast-moving boats. While a fast boat takes 12 hours connecting Óbidos to Manaus, a slow one takes three days, but it costs one-third of the fast boat. For example, the fast one connecting Santarém to Óbidos costs R$44 and the slow one just R$30. The fast boat from Manaus to Tabatinga costs R$540 and the slow one just R$330.\\n4- Bargain in order to get the best possible price\\nAlways ask for a discount on the offered price. Although the prices are fixed, there is always a chance to reduce the rate in R$10, R$20 or even R$30. Even the ticket shops make discounts.\\n5- Choose a boat with included meals\\nChoose a boat where meals are included. In some, you have to pay for your food and each meal can cost between R$10 and R$15. There are boats, usually the medium and small ones that offer meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Remember that you can repeat and eat more at meals hour – eat and drink well so that you won’t be hungry afterward.\\n6- Save money of a night at the hotel before departure\\nIf you wish to save the money for a night at the hotel, go to the boat on the previous evening to depart. I did it in Santana and Oriximiná. This means that if a boat leaves on a Saturday, you can sleep free of charge inside the boat on the previous night – just go inside and ask if you may. It is very usual, and you won’t probably be the only one. This way you can save money for one night at the hotel.\\n7- Buy snacks before getting in\\nIf you wish to bring supplies and snacks with you, buy them before you embark. Inside the ferry, everything is a bit more expensive. You will also find people that sell food along with the stops in different cities. The prices are usually similar to those you find in the city. People are selling fried banana, homemade cheese, sweets, ice-cream, finger food, and many local delicacies when the boat makes a stopover in other cities.\\n8- Don’t buy bottled water\\nDrink the water offered inside, which is free of charge, since all the boats have potable water. This way you don’t have to spend money on water to carry with you. It’s free in all boats, and you can fill your bottle with cold water at any time in the clean water machine – just look for it or ask where to find it.\\nLet’s say that you drink two 1,5l bottles per day: after a 10-day journey up or down the river you will have saved more than R$30. If you’re a couple or a group, you’ll save much more.\\n9- Don’t sleep in a cabin\\nChoose to rest in a hammock on the upper deck. Choosing a place in a cabin is four times more expensive than a simple spot with a resting hammock. A cabin can cost from R$400 up to R$1100 per trip.\\nFinal Price\\nYou are probably asking how much does it cost to travel by boat on the Amazon River? Traveling the Amazon while sleeping in a hammock, from Belém to Manaus, costs around R$350. The one from Manaus to Tabatinga also costs around R$350. Going upstream is more expensive, but it is the best way to go.\\nRead my page: 550 hours Amazon River boat trip\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\n8 Days Tibet Tour – Kathmandu to Lhasa Overland\\nI traveled from Kathmandu to Tibet in the month of August. As I was in Kathmandu the capital of Nepal, I decided to take the opportunity of being so close to visit Tibet, an autonomous region in China.\\nTo visit Tibet, all travelers need to buy a guided tour from a credited travel agency. So I purchased an 8-day Tibet tour from Kathmandu to Lhasa called – Roof of the World.\\nThe trips to Tibet can be made alone or in a group. But, you must always have a guide for you and a jeep/minibus, i.e., even if you choose to go alone you have to travel with a guide.\\nIn my case, I got the cheaper option and went with a group by minibus. In my group, there were ten interesting and very friendly travelers from different countries.\\nTibet is an autonomous region of the People’s Republic of China, situated right in the southwestern Chinese border of Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, and India.\\nI loved the mountain landscapes since Tibet is the highest region in the world, with almost all of its territory located above 13123 ft / 4000 m altitude. For this reason, Tibet is known as the “Roof of the World.”\\nI made the trip along the famous Friendship Highway from Kathmandu to Lhasa. This 497 mi / 800 km journey took me some impressive Buddhist monasteries filled with magic and spirituality.\\nTibet is a mysterious Buddhist land famous for its friendly and smiling people. On this page, I’ll describe step-by-step all the destinations I visited and give detailed information about the 8-day travel to Tibet along the Friendship Highway.\\nI bought my trip to Tibet in Kathmandu. Tibet is a mysterious, magical, spiritual place, and one of the most remote areas in the world. Nearly all Tibetans follow Tibetan Buddhism, also called Lamaism.\\nIndian Buddhism influenced Tibetan Buddhism in its early stages, but, over time, Tibetan Buddhism has developed its distinct characteristics and practices. One example of this difference is that Tibetans believe that there is a Living Buddha, i.e., there is a live reincarnation of the Buddha himself.\\nTo travel to Tibet, you must have a special permit from the Chinese government, and you need to buy a “tour package” at a travel agency so that they handle your transportation, accommodation, guide, and formalities.\\nFriendship Highway Map\\nMap of the Friendship Highway from Kathmandu to Lhasa\\nHow to travel in Tibet\\nHow to travel in Tibet – Kathmandu to Lhasa\\nHow to go to Tibet?\\nYou can only travel to Tibet with an organized tour bought to a credited travel agency. Between cities, you always have to be with a guide. The travel agency books transportation and hotels. Inside the towns, you’re free to explore alone. You can choose to get a 4X4 and go alone or with a group of people by minibus for a lower price. This last option is perfect for those who want a low-cost budget solution to travel in Tibet.\\nWhen to go to Tibet?\\nThe best time to go to Tibet is in summer when temperatures are warmer; thus you can travel to high altitudes with sun and enjoy stunning views of the mountains. Winters are cold with an average temperature of -2°C / 28ºF in January, but there is not much snow. Summer has hot days with intense sun, but cold nights.\\nFrom where to go to Tibet?\\nYou can choose to visit Tibet from Nepal departing from Kathmandu city, or from China. I made the overland trip along the Friendship Highway from Kathmandu to Lhasa and back to Kathmandu by plane over the Mount Everest. This route of the road N318 is breathtaking and has stunning scenery.\\nHow much does it cost to go to Tibet?\\nAn 8-day tour with accommodation, breakfast, transportation in private minibus with a driver, English-speaking guide, all entrances to monasteries and flight back to Kathmandu cost from 1000 to 1200 dollars. This price also includes the Nepalese guide and transportation in private minibus from Kathmandu to the border with China. A 4X4 tour is more expensive but you can split the price with more people. The cheapest and the best budget solution is the one I chose – in a private minibus with 10 other travelers.\\nHow to get a visa for Tibet?\\nTo visit Tibet from Nepal you don’t need a Chinese visa. Coming from Nepal and returning to Nepal, you only need a travel permit from the Chinese government that authorizes you to travel in this region for the specified time of the tour to Tibet. The travel permit to enter Tibet costs $30 dollars. The travel agency in Kathmandu will arrange everything for you.\\nWho goes to Tibet?\\nIf you travel with friends you already have company, but if not, you can always go with other travelers as I did. In Kathmandu’s hostels, there are many travelers searching for a tour operator. You can manage to get a small group and try to persuade the agency to make you a group discount. I booked my tour from Kathmandu to Lhasa alone through a travel agency located in Thamel. They put me on an organized tour. I was lucky to go with a very friendly group of people: 1 German guy who traveled by bicycle from Germany to Nepal; 2 Polish girls, 1 Swedish girl; 1 Austrian girl; 2 Chinese girls; 1 German couple; 1 German girl and 1 Spanish girl from Barcelona.\\nTibet 8-Day Tour\\nTibetan Buddhism\\nDay 1: Kathmandu – Zangmu – Nyalam\\nKathmandu 1400 m – Zangmu 2300 m – Nyalam 3750 m\\nBorder Nepal and Tibet-China – Kathmandu to Lhasa\\nThis part of the journey is made from Kathmandu all the way to Kodari (total 123km).

Today, this great ancient city is in ruins, and only a few monuments and the majestic city walls survived.\\nAfghanistan has always been the scene of conflicts due mainly to its Geo-strategic position but also to exploit its natural resources. The region is extremely rich in historic features with Arab, Mongol, Persian, Greek and Roman heritage.\\nThe Afghan culture is quite marked by political conflicts and several decade-long fighting.

Whoever has the courage to visit Afghanistan, will bring back incredible travel experiences.\\nBeautiful landscape in Afghanistan\\nThe history of Afghanistan begins in the fourth century BC when the mighty Persian Empire annexed this land to its territory. Later it was conquered by Alexander the Great, which allowed Greece to remain there for more than three centuries.\\nThe Arabs came into play in the year 651 but were never able to fully conquer the country.

This was the proper name the former colonizers of this tiny African island country gave to this inhospitable place.\\nMy knowledge about this place was a bit vague since I didn’t know what to do or where to go. The only reason I actually knew climbing a volcano in Cabo Verde was possible was due to a fellow traveler I met a few years ago in Mauritania.\\nIn recent history, Pico do Fogo volcano erupted in 1688, 1951, 1995, and more recently in 2014 lasting until February 8, 2015.\\nThe Experience\\nThe best way to explore the island is to get yourself a rental car or 4×4.

A Tuareg nomad camp in origin, it became one of West Africa’s most important commercial and religious outposts within only a couple of centuries.\\nSANKORE MOSQUE IN TIMBUKTU\\nIt was always a dream of mine to go to Timbuktu, and I didn’t even think twice about traveling there while on a trip to Mali a few years ago. Many people used to access the godforsaken city from Mopti, but I decided to do it the hard way. Yes, it seems that there was an even more challenging way to get to Timbuktu.\\nTIMBUKTU TRANSPORTATION FROM GAO\\nPretty cool, right? Well, at the time there was a bi-weekly pick-up truck crossing the desert from Gao. Although the trip usually takes from 9 to 10 hours, in this case, and due to specific issues, it lasted 22 hours.\\nSo, where did I have my life threatened on the way to Timbuktu? Meaning, is it even possible? No, I’m not writing this post to give an impression of my bravery or foolishness in engaging myself in such a trip. It’s just that the whole journey remains, to this day, among the craziest of experiences I’ve ever had in my life.\\nHow was my life in danger?\\nTimbuktu, Mali – How to get there the hard way\\nTo give a better understanding, allow me to explain the situation in further detail. Our driver was not from Mali but Mauritania, as it seems some Algerian and Mauritanians manage some businesses in Gao and Timbuktu. In this case, the weekly transportation was made with a Mauritanian Toyota Land Cruiser pick-up truck. For this particular trip, the only difference from previous trips was that the usual driver had fallen ill and his cousin sat in as his replacement.\\nSo far so good, right? Wrong. The substitute driver was to cross the desert, all the way to Timbuktu and for the first time in his life! Not just did he never drive there before but he had physically never even been to Timbuktu. Now, imagine a truck, full of cargo and 21 people, on a night trip into a bandit-filled region of the Sahara Desert and manned by a driver only knowing the directions he was given. Of course, people from Mauritania are known to be desert-oriented people and I know our driver knew how to navigate the wilderness. But, for a journey that usually takes 10 hours to end up taking 22? Is that even logical?\\nWell, if you have been to Mauritania (as I have been, seven times) and can piece all the evidence together, you can understand that in this part of the world and with a Mauritanian at the wheel, anything possible can happen. And so, it did.\\nDanger en-route to Timbuktu – Part 1\\nHOW TO GET TO TIMBUKTU\\nAt about 1:00 am, the driver began ascending a dune where a Malian army compound was located. Halfway to the top, we were stopped at gunpoint, the main problem being the driver not hearing the warning to halt since the truck cab’s music was too loud. Moving in 4-wheel-drive, then the army lights and guns pointed at us, I noticed everyone jumping off the vehicle while it was still moving. Not understanding what the army men were saying, I just followed the others to the ground and put my hands up.\\n“S’il vous plait, ne tirez pas!” (Please, don’t shoot!), I heard a few of my companions anxiously shouting towards the armed men. The vehicle eventually stopped when the Mauritania driver finally noticed what the heck was going on!\\nYes, this entire region is highly susceptible to rebel attacks and, precisely, we could have been a group of rebels trying to reach the army compound. Luckily, they didn’t shoot upon sight of us.\\nIn retrospect, the ridiculous thing about the whole situation was in my memory of the innocent face of the driver being interrogated by the Malian officer, the proceeding exchange and, since they spoke different languages, their reverting to French to communicate:\\nOfficer: Who are you and what are you doing here with these people?\\nDriver: This is my truck. I’m the driver.\\nOfficer: But why are you coming this way?\\nDriver: I’m heading to Timbuktu.\\nOfficer: Timbuktu is not this way. You’re going in the wrong direction!\\nDriver: Oh God bless! So which way is it then?\\nOfficer: Are you joking to my face?\\nDriver: By God, no way!\\nOfficer: You don’t know the way?\\nDriver: No.\\nOfficer: And you’re driving in the middle night with the car full of people?\\nDriver: (silence)\\nOfficer: What are you doing here?\\nDriver: My cousin is sick, so I’m replacing him. I know the desert, so I will learn today how to get there. We will get to Timbuktu by God’s will.\\nOfficer: This is unacceptable, people! Get lost! Dégage!!!\\nDriver: Wa alaykumu s-salam. (and the peace upon you)\\nAfter more conversation and passport checks, we were all left in peace. Some of the passengers then demanded the driver stop for four hours so everyone could rest before continuing on to Timbuktu.\\nDanger en-route to Timbuktu – Part 2\\nMY NEW FRIEND ON THE WAY TO TIMBUKTU IN NORTHERN MALI\\nWhile waiting to sleep, everyone chose his resting place on the sand. Selecting an area in front of the truck, I lied down and closed my eyes. Suddenly, an inner feeling struck, a kind of awareness spasm, while I spontaneously stood up to change my place. I then went to lie near some nearby vegetation. While preparing to sleep, the pick-up’s hand break cracked causing the truck to move forward at least 3 meters, precisely where I would have been lying down!\\nAt around 9:00 am, we stopped to ask for directions. There, someone told us Timbuktu was two hours away. After four more hours, we stopped again and were told Timbuktu was the other direction, five hours away! Now, I don’t quite understand what occurred, maybe time-travel, but did we actually go the opposite direction after asking for directions?\\nFunny story: After almost all the passengers had disembarked in the middle of the desert, the half-empty truck proceeded onward with me, two men, one child, and two goats.\\nTRAVELING IN MALI\\nNo comment. Needless to say, I arrived in Timbuktu 22 hours after we started in Gao, northern Mali, and just before sunset.\\nA brief curiosity: After this insane journey, I wasn’t expecting that leaving Timbuktu would be difficult. Well, it was not easy! The 4×4 taxi I took broke down near Hombori, adding five additional hours to expected travel time to reach Mopti. Based on this and all these experiences, I must admit Timbuktu’s reputation of being difficult to reach and tough to get out of proved to be more than true.\\nRead my page: Timbuktu the Mysterious\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Tajikistan is a fascinating country located in the eastern part of Central Asia.\\nInternational tourism statistics show that the annual number of arrivals in Tajikistan is not higher than a quarter of a million. Although being among one of the least visited countries in the world, Tajikistan has a lot to explore. In my humble point of view, the most beautiful mountain landscapes in Central Asia are in Tajikistan.\\nBut wait, my page is not about Tajikistan, the country, but a region that is even more remote.

You are not allowed to take pictures at some specific sections of the border, especially near border crossings and bridges.\\nShrine of Ali\\nALI SHRINE TAJIKISTAN\\nUpon the death of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and to avoid the desecration of his grave, his exact burial site was kept secret. Forty different mausoleums were built in different countries and one of them is located in Namadgut village.

The doors of the site are open and you can just go inside on your own.\\nDarshay\\nDARSHAY TAJIKISTAN\\nOn the main road just before Darshay village, there is an impressive slot canyon. A slot canyon is a narrow canyon, formed by the wear of water rushing through rock.

You can have a nice hike for two or three days in Darshay Gorge up to 25 km far and observe the wildlife and the beauty of the landscape. Up in Darshay Gorge, there is a yurt camp where you can stay. The ranger of the protected region will guide you and tell you more about the history of Sarshaydara and show you the wildlife and the ancient petroglyphs. This area is home to the Alpine ibex wild goat, the snow leopard, and different bird species such as the Himalayan vulture, the bearded vulture also known as the lammergeier, the Asia chukar partridge, and many others.

Yes, there is an ancient Buddhist Stupa in the middle of Tajik Wakhan Corridor. Interesting, isn’t it? From Vrang village, you can go up the hill following the path carved on the stone floor. Fro the top of the building and try to imagine how the Wahkan used to be when Buddhism prevailed. The Buddhist temple in Vrang bears the lost resemblance to ancient monuments of Eastern Turkestan. Its origin is traced back to archaeological findings dated back to the 5th and 6th-century AD. This is the only monument of this kind in the region. Based on old written reports by Chinese travelers, there used to exist another Buddhist temple with an old statue of Buddha on the left bank of the river in the town of Khandut, the ancient capital of Wakhan.\\nKala-e Panja\\nKALA-E PANJA TAJIKISTAN\\nKala-e Panja can’t really be visited when you’re in Tajikistan since it’s located on the Afghan side. But the strategic position it holds creates a lovely photogenic scenario: Panj River, the mountains, Tajik and Afghan villages. If by chance you spot some army patrolling the border, avoid taking pictures. Just wait until they pass and go for it.\\nFortress Abrashim Qala\\nFORTRESS ABRASHIM QALA TAKIJISTAN\\nAbrashim Qala is located in Zong village, just 7 km before Langar. It was built to protect the Silk Road from Chinese and Afghan invaders. The strategic location of the castle makes possible to view the junction of River Panj and River Wakhan, where the Wakhan Valley geographically ends.\\nLangar Petroglyphs\\nLANGAR TAJIKISTAN\\nLangar is located 113 km / 70 mi away from Ihskshim. This is the last village of my proposed Tajik Wakhan itinerary. If you love Rock art, Langar will have a double impact on you: from one side, you will love to explore and discover the ancient engravings, but, from another side, your heart will be broken to notice a large number of destroyed carvings. So, explore far from the village. Near the cemetery is where the most destroyed figures are located. Get yourself a guide or walk farther to enjoy over 6000 ancient petroglyphs!\\nRatm Fort\\nRATM FORT TAJIKISTAN\\nRatm Fort is located 6 km away from Langar. Although my proposed itinerary would stop in Langar, I just can’t write this article without mentioning this interesting castle. This building has more than 2-millennia of history, and after a good 15-minute walk you can reach it, crossing fields and some isolated houses.\\nRead the pages: A guide to the Wakhan Valley in Tajikistan by @AgainstCompass and How To Visit Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor (Safety, Visas, Cost) by @expertvagabond.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Segregation of women vs. men, the strict ban of practicing other religions, and the death penalty by public decapitation or crucifixion did not help to create an image of Saudi being a safe haven for foreigners.\\nSharīʿah, also spelled Sharia, is the fundamental religious concept of Islam, namely its law, systematized during 8th–9th centuries CE.\\nQuote.\\nBeing Islam for most of us, a very different religion both culturally and in practice, Saudi Arabia is probably more unknown and unreachable than any other country on Earth.\\nCombining this cultural reality and contrasts, with the fact of Saudis not issuing tourist visas, the country maintained its status of being inaccessible.\\nJust until recently, getting a tourist visa to Saudi Arabia was impossible.\\nMost travelers were basically just placing Saudia at the end of their countries to visit, not because they wouldn’t like to go, just because there was no way of getting in.\\nRecent government change and social rules being adjusted in this strict culture, the new King Mohammad bin Salman indeed set up new orders to develop and diversify the nation’s economy, and one of his main interests is to actually open the country for foreign touris.\\nPlaces such as Jeddah old city, Jubbah petroglyphs, old Ad-Deerah village in Al Ula, Al Ghat, Ushaiqir heritage village, the UNESCO sites of Mada’in Saleh and Ad Diriyah in Riyadh, and many other places will soon be open for those who visit Saudi Arabia.\\nMOSQUE IN SAUDI ARABIA\\nAre you excited to go already?\\nNow, back to the point of Saudi Arabia being dangerous.\\nWhy do people even make this question? This is quite a complex argument, and trying to quickly explain is hard and will most definitely not be entirely accurate. I will try to tell you a bit about this complicated matter to make you understand a few crucial subjects around the issue.\\nDuring the last decades, we’ve seen Muslim jihadist groups fighting against what it seems to be, in their logic, the desecration of Muslim lands by non-muslim armies and politics.\\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Lybia, Syria are always on the news, and images of Salafi Muslim fighters cutting heads of westerners were indeed shocking for both the majority of Muslims and non-Muslims around the world.\\nRead my page:\\nDriving in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah to Riyadh Road Trip – Two Weeks/3000 km\\nLet’s go back in time a bit:\\nThe Soviet-Afghan War lasted over nine years, from December 1979 until February 1989.\\nThe presence of American influence in Afghanistan and their economic support of the Taliban to fight against the Russians, created a long-term regional disaster that originated the creation of other branches of terrorist groups that keep on destabilizing the region, until the big event and ultimate game changer for jihadists groups such Al-Qaida. I’m talking about the Iraqi war.\\nThe invasion of Iraq by US forces under the false pretext of Saddam having weapons of mass destruction (which is now openly known to be false), destroyed one of the most stable countries in the region and destabilized the whole Middle East along with it.\\nThe political vacuum and “anarchic” period posterior to the Iraqi invasion gave birth to even more terrorist cells that engaged themselves on the creation of something unbelievable in the 21st century: the establishment of a Caliphate like as if the world was hundred years back in time.\\nA caliphate is a country with the rule or reign of a caliph or chief Muslim ruler. And do you know what? Al-Qaida and ISIS did manage to create a land of their own, a new Islamic State and their capital was Mosul in northern Iraq.\\nThis emphasized the whole mess around Islam vs. The West issue.\\nBut why am I even talking about Afghanistan and Iraq when questioning safety in Saudi Arabia?\\nAgain, it is not that simple to explain this, and I do have to make you understand a few points.\\nThe Salafi movement is usually characterized as being identical to Wahhabism, but Salafists consider the term “Wahhabi” derogatory.\\nA Wahhabi is one who follows Wahhabism or the teachings of Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab, a man born in Saudi Arabia.\\nWahhabism has always been a form of Salafism, and, as a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafis, but not all Salafis are Wahhabis.\\nWahabism, which is an ideological doctrine created in the 18th century, teaches fundamentalist Islam, and that rejects any renewal or regenerating Islam values, and culturally fights against obvious Western influence, democracy and Shia Muslims (another branch of Islam with around 400 million followers).\\nSalafi jihadism or jihadist-Salafism is a transnational religious-political ideology based on a belief in “physical” jihadism and the Salafi movement of returning to what adherents believe to be true Sunni Islam.\\nQuote.\\nNow I will get to the point (yes finally!). Wahabism was designed by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and which almost 30% of Saudis supposedly recognize and follow as their main view and way of practicing Islam.\\nDuring the establishment of the country, the alliance between followers of ibn Abd al-Wahhab and successors of Muhammad bin Saud (the House of Saud) created the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the Mohammed bin Abd al-Wahhab teachings are sponsored by the Saudi state, being the dominant form of Islam in the country until today. Also, 47% of the population of Qatar and 45% of Emiratis follow Wahabism.\\nSome Wahabis around the region supported and financed jihadist groups, and while on a culture clash and fight for power and religion, jihadi Salafi militant groups based on the Wahabi doctrine taught and dissipated a very harsh and non-tolerant war against everything that goes against their way of seeing the world. This affected mostly Muslims in the region, that don’t follow their way of Islam, and other religions such as Christians and Yazidi.\\nMOSQUE IN RIYADH – SAUDI ARABIA\\nStop it! Just tell me: Is Saudi dangerous?\\nNo, not at all.\\nIf you follow the country strict rule of law, Saudi Arabia is crime and theft free.\\nMany people do leave their car working while going to the supermarket, not worrying about any possible theft. Women, while having to dress conservatively, are not worried about crime against them.\\nIf you keep your political and religious views to yourself, Saudi is a safe country.\\nFriendly Saudis camping in the desert\\nPlease take into consideration:\\nSaudi Arabia is explicitly an Islamic state, with no separation between state and religion.\\nRespect people’s beliefs.\\nDress conservatively, even men cover their arms and legs.\\nIf you don’t believe in God, do not say this out loud. Not just because you’re being rude to Muslims around the world, but mostly because it is blasphemy in Saudi Arabia.\\nBlasphemy is treated as apostasy and is criminalized and punishable by death (by beheading and crucifixion).\\nSome Saudis are very dangerous drivers. If you rent a car in KSA, always double check your rear-view mirror.\\nBlasphemy is the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence to a deity, or sacred objects, or toward something considered sacred or inviolable.\\nQuote\\nAre you still here? Please don’t be scared.\\nCan I tell you a little secret?\\nAround two million Christians live in Saudi Arabia.\\nCan I tell you another little secret?\\nThe majority of Saudis (like most Muslims around the world) are incredibly hospitable, kind and generous to foreigners.

Yerevan it’s a pleasant city that reflects the true nature of the Armenians, and with always-present Mount Ararat dominating the landscape.\\nThe history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC when a fortress was built, and which can be visited during your stay. Throughout the ages, Yerevan was conquered by multiple invaders: Persians, Arabs, Ottomans, and Russians.\\nAlthough the historic center of Yerevan was destroyed in the first half of the twentieth century to give way to a new city with monumental buildings and ample spaces, the city has a very unique charm.\\nCuriosities about Yerevan:\\nYerevan it’s home to over a million people;\\nYerevan is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities;\\nErebuni fortress in Yerevan is at least 2800 years old;\\nYerevan has an average height of 990 m (3,248 ft);\\nYerevan has long hot summers and cold winters;\\nYerevan is located at the northeast of the Ararat plain;\\nThe Yerevan TV Tower is the tallest building in the city;\\nYerevan is between the top 10 safest cities in the world;\\nThe Mother Armenia replaced a monumental statue of Joseph Stalin.\\nThe symbolic universe of the Soviet Union can still be felt, and visitors will have much to be entertained. Strolling through the streets of the city and its most important squares will leave a mark on your memory, and there are numerous museums of which I will point out only the most important ones.\\nAbout one million people live in the Armenian capital, and you can experience the hospitality and friendliness of the inhabitants of Yerevan, roaming the residential areas and their very private courtyards that function as centers for the community that surrounds them.\\nYerevan Top 5\\nRepublic Square\\nNational Gallery of Armenia\\nFortress of Erebuni\\nYerevan Cascade\\nKatoghike Church\\nWhat to visit in Yerevan\\nMost famous sites\\nRepublic Square\\nBlue Mosque\\nLiberty Square\\nArarat Brandy Museum\\nKentron Stairs\\nNational Gallery of Armenia\\nGenocide Memorial Museum\\nVernissage’s Old Market\\nMother Armenia\\nMilitary Museum\\nFortress of Erebuni\\nOpera and Theater\\nVictoria Park\\nMatenadaran\\nYerevan History Museum\\nAvehak Isahakian House\\nCafesjian Art Center\\nKatoghike Church\\nMap of Attractions\\nTours in Yerevan\\nYerevan City Guide\\nRepublic Square\\nThe locals call it Hraparak. It is located in the district of Kentron, right in the center of Yerevan. It is a spacious square that took almost fifty years to build. Its construction advanced especially in the ’50s of the last century, following a megalomaniac project created by the architect Alexander Tamanyan around 1920.\\nIt is the ideal place to spend some time watching the architecture and people passing. In Republic Square, you will find buildings such as the famous Armenia Marriot Hotel, the Armenian History Museum, the Ministry of Communications and the Government Headquarters, which are part of the structures that emerged in the first phase and which are defined as Neo-Classics influenced by the traditional Armenian style.\\nThe National Gallery of Armenia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, built later, are modernist buildings.\\nOne of the most exciting features of the square is its musical fountains, which between spring and autumn offer a remarkable show, with water fountains of variable configuration, very well lit and whose effects evolve to the sound of music of varied genres.\\nBlue Mosque\\nThe Blue Mosque, or Kapuyt Mzkit in Armenian, was initially built in 1765 but was closed at the beginning of the 20th century when the Soviet Union was formed following the Revolution of 1917. By 1931 all religious services were suspended, and the mosque was used to house the Museum of the City of Yerevan.\\nAfter Armenia’s independence in 1991, the mosque was almost entirely rebuilt, with Iranian funding, and is currently the only Muslim temple active throughout the country.\\nIt is clearly more beautiful on the outside, with the walls decorated by beautiful mosaics, while the interior is austere. It has a colorful dome, a minaret and is surrounded by well-kept gardens where there are some fountains. There is an interior courtyard, and there are a library and a theological school.\\nThe mosque is in the center, more specifically on Mashtots Avenue, and can be visited between 10:00 and 13:00 and 15:00 and 18:00.\\nLiberty Square\\nHaving been called Opera Square and Theater until 1991, since these buildings are dominant in that area, Liberty Square is located in the central part of the city, in the district of Kentron. It is one of the most important squares of the Armenian capital and considered a symbol of democracy due to the important political demonstrations held here in the past.\\nLiberty Square ample space can receive between 40 and 50 thousand people. There is a large underground car park with a capacity of 500 cars. It was built in the summer of 2008, and some say that the project was designed to avoid the use of space for anti-government demonstrations at a critical time when a large part of the population contested the legitimacy of the election results that took place that year.\\nIn the square, you can notice the statues of the writer Hovhannes Tumanyan and the composer Alexander Spendiaryan.\\nYerevan Cascade (Kentron Stairs)\\nThe broad staircase connecting the Kentron area to the hilltop area of the monuments of Yerevan is one of the most iconic sites in the Armenian capital. It was initially built in 1971, in the era of the Soviet Union, and entirely renovated already in the period of independent Armenia in 2009.\\nThe complex is actually composed of two staircases, which line an architectural complex that functions as a waterfall. There are eight levels of stairs, but anyone who is not up to the challenge can use the existing elevator.\\nThe Yerevan Cascade is adorned by trimmed gardens and diverse statuary, while the Cafesjian Cente for the Arts is embedded in the staircase.\\nFrom the top, there is a fabulous view of the city which is especially recommended at the end of the day, when public lighting starts to light up.\\nNational Gallery of Armenia\\nNational Gallery of Armenia\\nThe National Gallery of Armenia was established in 1921 by the decision of the Government of the Soviet Republic of Armenia. It was located on Astafian Street, in a two-story building that had been a men’s high school.\\nAfter changing its name a couple of times, following the country’s independence in 1991, it was renamed the National Gallery of Armenia. This was followed by a reorganization that allowed collections of other State museums to be brought together in the National Gallery, along with groups of medieval and ancient Armenian art and Russian paintings.\\nThese were difficult times, however: the collapse of the Soviet Union broke almost 100-year ties with various institutions of the same type throughout the USSR, and economic difficulties did not allow connections with galleries in other countries.\\nIn 2002 a new director was chosen: Paravon Mirzoyan. Under his guidance, the gallery became an independent, non-profit organization and funds were obtained for a thorough renovation completed in 2004.\\nThe gallery can be visited every day except Mondays, between 11:00 and 17:00, although on Sunday it closes an hour earlier. The ticket costs 1,500 Drams.\\nHistory Museum of Armenia\\nThis museum is located in Republic Square, right in the center of the city. It was founded in 1919, and at that time it was renamed Ethno-Anthropological Museum and Library. Throughout its course, it changed name several times, until the current denomination was chosen in 2003.\\nThe History Museum of Armenia was initially established with a group of collections gathered for the purpose, but in 1935 the collected materials were dispersed by smaller museums, created at the time.\\nIt is the state museum, which currently holds more than 400,000 pieces, with particular emphasis on the areas of numismatics and archeology, but with significant collections in of ethnography and documentation.\\nIndividually we can highlight the 782 BC cuneiform inscription of the foundation of the city, at the time called Erebuni, and also the exhibitions of ancient Armenian bronze coins from the third century BC.\\nThe museum is open every day except Mondays, between 11:00 and 18:00 and the ticket costs 2,000 Drams.\\nThe Armenian Genocide Museum-institute\\nThe Armenian Genocide Museum is a complex known as Tsitsernakaberd. It highlights and recalls the so-called “Armenian Genocide,” which the Armenian people were subjected by the Ottoman Empire from April 1915 onwards.\\nThe existing monument in the place appeared in the middle of century XX. The construction began in 1966, following a series of movements by prominent Armenian personalities and street demonstrations that demanded that the Soviet power recognize the existence of genocide.\\nWhen it was completed in 1967, the population could see the 44-meter stele that stood there, symbolizing the rebirth of the Armenian people. Twelve blocks arranged in a circle represent the twelve provinces lost to Turkey, and in the center, there is an eternal flame. In the square, there is a wall with a hundred meters with the names of settlements where massacres and deportations existed.\\nThe Museum emerged later, having opened to the public in 1995, that is, the 80th anniversary of the genocide. The building was designed by the architects Sashur Kalashian and Lyudmila Mkrtchyan and by the sculptor F. Araqelyan.\\nThe Museum is open every day except Mondays, from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm and entrance is free.\\nArarat Brandy Museum\\nSince this is a Christian country, the production of alcoholic beverages in Armenia has a long tradition, with particular emphasis on the brandy, being Ararat the most reputable brand.\\nArarat brandy began to be produced back in 1887. It was Nerses Tairyants merchant that invested in the distillery, then installed in the fortress of Yerevan which he also bought.\\nIn 1889 Nikolai Shustov acquired the business and the following year sent some bottles to Paris, where they had an unexpected success.\\nIn 1913 the company was producing 82,000 bottles of brandy a year, and Nikolai Shustov had been appointed an official supplier to the Russian imperial court.\\nIn 1920, following the Soviet Revolution, the company was nationalized. In 1953 the old premises were no longer sufficient, and the distillery moved to a larger place, changing the name to Yerevan Brandy Company.\\nTake into consideration that you must schedule the museum visit in advance. If you just show up there, you will not be allowed in.\\nYerevan Vernissage open-air market\\nThis market is held every day, from morning to late afternoon, but is clearly more lively at weekends. It extends for the 350 meters that separate the streets Arand and Buzand, in the center of Yerevan. In Vernissage Market you can find pieces of art, tapestry, jewelry, books, numismatics, musical instruments and much more. In short, a box of surprises with a fantastic environment whose visit is recommended especially if you walk through Yerevan at the weekend.\\nThe tradition of this market began in the 1980s, when local artists began to display their works on the street, near the Artists’ Union of Armenia. This is where the name vernissage comes from, a French word describing a preview of an art exhibition.\\nMother Armenia Military Museum\\nThe Monument of Mother Armenia occupies a strategic position, having been built on a hilltop near the center of Yerevan. The statue depicting Mother Armenia is made of copper and is set on a huge basalt-inspired bastion in the shape of an orthodox church of three naves, totaling 51 meters in height.\\nThe monument was created in 1961, and designed by architect Rafayel Israyelian and sculptor Ara Harutyunyan. At the base of the statue is the small Military Museum, whose collection is not especially rich, but offers a pleasant visit to anyone who decides to go.\\nThe exhibition is devoted almost exclusively to the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, caused by the dispute of control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.\\nThe Museum is open every day except Mondays, from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. Sundays, from 10:00 to 3:00 pm.\\nErebuni Fortress\\nFrom the fortress of Erebuni, the historical core of Yerevan, there is little left. It was initially built in the 8th century BC by King Argishti I, who chose the top of a hill rising about 65 meters over the rest of the city.\\nArchaeological works, which began around 1950, revealed a very sober original plan, which was characteristic of the architecture of the time. The dominant building material was mud bricks, and the segments that survived to this day show us that the tallest walls reached 12 meters.\\nIn the complex, there were religious buildings, a palace, and several residences. Some vestiges prove a rich decoration of the walls, especially in shades of blue, and the abundant use of floral motifs.\\nApart from the fortress visit, you can enjoy breathtaking views of the entire Armenian capital. It is usually a quiet and relaxing place, ideal for those looking to get away from the urban bustle.\\nYerevan Opera Theatre\\nThe building of the Yerevan Opera Theatre was designed by the architect Alexander Tamanian, who used a revolutionary solution, uniting the two auditoriums in a single block, very uniform and semicircular. One can note the aesthetic influences of medieval Armenian architecture, applied in a stylized way.\\nThe theater segment was completed in 1939 and part of the opera was added in 1963, but what we see today is the result of a total renovation that took place in 1980.\\nThe theater room has a capacity for 1,260 spectators while the opera house can hold 1,400 people, both having an amphitheater layout and endowed with extraordinary acoustic qualities.\\nVictoria Park\\nThe Victory Park celebrates the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II, having been created in the ’50s of the last century. It is located at the top of the Norksk hill and is very popular with the residents of Yerevan. The monument of Mother Armenia and its small military museum is located in Victoria Park.\\nThe park has all the infrastructures one would expect to find in such a space, with several rails, an artificial lake, garden benches and a series of cafes. There are also amusements such as carousels and other entertainment venues. In addition to all this, the views from here are magnificent, and you can see the entire center of Yerevan.\\nMatenadaran\\nIn archaic Armenian, matenadaran means “deposit of books.” It functions as the National Archives of Armenia, having as its initial collection the manuscripts that belonged to the Echmiadzin Monastery (Vagharshapat).\\nThe archive, which is also a scientific research center for ancient manuscripts, was opened in 1959 and currently has a collection of more than 17,000 ancient manuscripts and 100,000 documents of historical value. In addition to the Armenian manuscripts, which form the backbone of the property, there are also manuscripts in Russian, Hebrew, Latin, Arabic, Syrian, Greek, Japanese, and Persian.\\nThe earliest documents date from the fifth century, and there is a remarkable collection of printed books from the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.\\nThe Matenadaran was built on the basis of the architectural traditions of the 12th and 13th centuries and in the surrounding space, you can see a monument dedicated to Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of the Armenian alphabet, accompanied by other great names of the national culture, such as Movses Khorenatsi, Anani Shrakatsi, Mkhitar Gosh, Torinos Roslin, Frik and Gregory Tatecatsi.\\nThe Matenadaran can be partially visited, being open every day except on Mondays, between 10:00 and 17:00.\\nYerevan History Museum\\nThe Yerevan History Museum was created in 1931 and called, at the time, Museum of the Community, assuming its current denomination five years later. It initially operated on the second floor of the fire station, and from 1936 it was installed in the blue mosque. Already after the independence of Armenia, it passed through the facilities of two high schools before finding its present residence in the new building of the Town Hall, designed by the architect Jim Torosyan.\\nIt has a collection of 90 thousand pieces, with emphasis on archeology, ethnography, numismatics, arts, photography and documentation sections.\\nThe Yerevan History Museum exposition tells the story of the human presence in Yerevan, with some particular highlights, from six-thousand-year-old artifacts found in Shengavit, to frescoes and cuneiform documents brought from the Erebuni Fortress.\\nThis museum is closed on Sundays and is open on all other days between 11:00 and 17:30. The ticket costs 500 Drams.\\nHouse-Museum of Avetik Isahakian\\nThis is one of about ten house-museums existing in Yerevan, worth in part for a sense of antiquity that is not easy to be found in the city. Avetik Isahakian was a poet and writer who left an indelible mark in the Armenian society.\\nAvetik Isahakian works have long been studied in Armenian schools, and in 1945, the year of his seventieth birthday, the country offered him this residence that became a museum in 1963.\\nHere the visitor can observe the poet’s private rooms, a significant collection of his belongings, a series of pieces of art that belonged to him and his personal library. It is also a portrait of mid-twentieth-century Yerevan and the daily life of its residents.\\nThe house can be visited every day except on Mondays, between 11:00 and 16:00. The ticket costs 500 Drams, and guided tours in English can be arranged, costing 2,500 Drams.\\nCafesjian Museum of Art\\nCafesjian Museum of Art was opened in 2009 and is located in Kentron stairs. The center has five different galleries. In the Khanjyan gallery, you can see the murals of the painter Grigor Khanjyan, who died in 2000, that dealt with themes related to the history of Armenia.\\nThrough the Eagle gallery, there are temporary exhibitions with pieces belonging to private individuals. In the Sasuntsi Davit gallery, there’s a collection of more than one hundred pieces of glass by the Czech artists Stanislav Libensky and Jaroslava Brychtova. The Swarowsky gallery displays Swarovski swatch items, created by Vincent Van Duysen, Tord Boontje, Georg Baldele, Michael Anastassiades, Diller Scofido, and Renfro Studio.\\nThe gallery is open from Tuesday to Thursday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm and from Friday to Sunday from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm, closing on Mondays. Part of the space can be visited for free, but a 1,000 Drams ticket is required to access the remaining galleries.\\nKatoghike Church\\nKatoghike Church dates originally from the thirteenth century, but from what we see today there is little left of its original medieval construction. In 1679 a violent earthquake made Yerevan shake, and Katoghike Church was one of the structures that didn’t survive. The present church is, therefore, the result of the reconstruction carried out in the following years.\\nThe church does not have a dome, presenting a characteristic plant of Armenian religious architecture, with three naves. There are two entrances to the south and west.\\nDuring the Soviet era, the authorities decided to build housing blocks on the site, and the church was condemned to destruction, but when workers found vestiges of the original building the population and scientific community united and pressured the Government and consequently the church was spared.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nWhat to visit in Reykjavík the capital of Iceland\\nReykjavík is the capital of Iceland. With 123,000 people, Reykjavík is a small city and the only one in the country. It combines some classical Scandinavian style buildings, which means wooden houses painted in bright colors, with modern structures that were built before the Icelandic economy crash (2008-2011).\\nReykjavík has a cosmopolitan vibe, with lots of culture and interesting restaurants and cafes, but the cost of living is high and sometimes unbearable for tourists.\\nReykjavík city was founded in the 18th century but always remained small, almost like a village. The Second World War and the influx of North-American and British soldiers brought new life to the Icelandic economy and the city continued to grow until 2008.\\nHouses in Reykjavík are scattered all over the city, but the historic center is compact and most points of interest are within walking distance.\\nBuzzing with creative energy and passion, Reykjavík and its surrounding towns offer a mix of culture and adventure in any season.\\nReykjavík Top 5\\nSun Voyager Monument\\nBlue Lagoon Spa\\nHallgrimskirkja\\nOld Reykjavík\\nWhale Watching\\nWhat to visit in Reykjavík\\nMost famous sites\\nHallgrimskirkja\\nHarpa Concert Hall\\nPerlan\\nSun Voyager Monument\\nLaugavegur\\nNational Museum of Iceland\\nTjörnin Lake\\nVidey Island\\nSettlement Exhibition\\nPhallological Museum\\nÁrbaer Open Air Museum\\nReykjavík Town Hall\\nNauthólsvík Beach\\nHöfdi House\\nReykjavik Art Museum\\nReykjavík Maritime Museum\\nOld Harbour Souvenirs\\nKolaportid Flea Market\\nNational Gallery\\nImagine Peace Tower\\nThrihnukagigur Volcano\\nGrótta Lighthose\\nAurora Reykjavík Museum\\nWhales of Iceland Museum\\nSaga Museum\\nThe Einar Jónsson Museum\\nAusturvöllur Square\\nReykjavík Cathedral\\nCathedral of Christ the King\\nReykjavík Art Museum\\nThe Culture House\\nFlyOver Iceland\\nMap of Attractions\\nTours in Reykjavík\\nReykjavík City Guide\\nHallgrímskirkja Church\\nThis Lutheran Church is the biggest in Iceland and one of the tallest structures in the country, 74.5 meters high. Designed by Guðjón Samúelsson in 1937, an incredibly bold project for its time, the temple was inspired by the natural shapes of lava turned into basalt rock and the Icelandic glaciers. Construction began in 1945 but was only finished in 1986. Extensive maintenance work happened in 2008. It’s said the original plan wasn’t for such a tall church, but the leaders of Iceland’s Lutheran Church wanted the temple to surpass Landakotskirkja, the highest Catholic church on the island. It’s open to the public and a ticket to visit the tower, accessible by elevator, costs ISK 900. From the top, you can see the whole city and part of its surroundings.\\nBlue Lagoon Spa\\nBlue Lagoon Spa\\nThe Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa close to Reykjavik and one of Iceland’s most famous places. The water in the lagoon is rich in different minerals and is known to have benefits for various skin conditions. It’s an artificial lagoon filled with water coming in from a nearby spring, which is replaced completely every two days. People have been bathing there since 1976 but the place only became popular in 1992. Access to the lagoon is paid and expensive, but if you just want to take a look, you can walk around and have an overview of the place, seeing the milky waters flowing in the canals around the lake.\\nChrist the King Cathedral\\nThis cathedral, known in Iceland as Landakotskirkja, is the main Catholic church in the country. It was built on land bought by the first Catholic priests who came to the island at the beginning of the 19th century. Initially, they built a wooden chapel, but after the First World War, the resident Catholics wanted to build a more solid structure. The Neogothic church was designed by Guðjón Samúelsson and finished making in 1929. At the time, it was the tallest church in Iceland. The church is open to the public every day if you wish to visit, and they celebrate Mass in several languages.\\nSólfar Sculpture – The Sun Voyager\\nThe Sun Voyager\\nThis sculpture is probably Reykjavik’s best-known picture. It’s been by the sea since 1990. It’s a stainless-steel creation by Jón Gunnar Árnason, who passed away one year before the inauguration. Although it resembles a Viking Drakkar, that wasn’t the author’s intention, who created what he believed was a ship of dreams and an ode to the sun. It’s within walking distance from the city center and it’s a great place to photograph, especially at sunset with the Mount Esja in the background.\\nHarpa Concert Hall and Conference Center\\nThe Harpa is a contemporary building that was under construction for four years and was inaugurated in 2011. It’s dedicated to shows, culture, and it’s also a conference center. The original project was far more ambitious and included a hotel with 400 rooms, luxury apartments, shops, parking lots, and the headquarters of a bank. The financial crisis, however, reduced the project to something simpler, which is now the building we see in the center of Reykjavik. Harpa was designed by architect company Henning Larsen and the façade was designed by Ólafur Elíasson. There are four concert halls, and the main one sits 1,800 people. A big part of the complex, located near the water, can be visited for free during the day.\\nNauthólsvík Beach\\nThis beach is an alternative to the famous Blue Lagoon but it’s only open during the summer. It’s in Reykjavik, by the Atlantic coast, and the water has an average temperature between 15 and 18 degrees Celsius. Depending on the time of the year, though, the temperature fluctuates due to the mix of ocean waters and geothermal springs. There’s a spot where the water is always at 38 degrees Celsius, open to the public all year. It’s near Ægissíða, a pedestrian and bike lane that’s very popular with locals in the Icelandic capital. Although it was only open in 2001, it’s now visited by a record number of half a million people a year, almost the double of the country’s population. The beach is one part of the leisure area of Nauthólsvík bay, named after a former farm that used to be there.\\nMuseums in Reykjavík\\nNational Gallery of Iceland\\nThe National Gallery of Iceland was founded in 1884 in Copenhagen, Denmark, the country that governed Iceland at the time. The museum was independent until 1916 when the Icelandic Parliament decided for it to be a part of the National Heritage Museum. The Gallery had two addresses before it came to its current location: it was located in the House of Parliament until 1950. That year the collection was moved into the main building of the National Museum, where it was formally opened to the public. Then finally in 1987, the National Gallery of Iceland was transferred to the current location, a 1916 building. The permanent collection includes pieces of Icelandic art from the 19th and the 20th century but also works of international artists like Pablo Picasso and Edward Munch. It’s not a permanent exhibition, it’s the pieces of the vast collection on display in alternation.\\nArbaer Museum\\nThis is an open-air museum, which you can call an ethnographical museum, where you can see houses and functional buildings that were brought from other parts of the country or were built as replicas to show the visitors how people used to live and still do in remote areas. The Arbaer Museum has 20 buildings that recreate a traditional square, a village, and a farm. The Museum was created in 1957 when people began to feel that traditional Reykjavík was vanishing, and they wanted to keep a memory of what the Icelandic capital used to be like for future generations. There used to be a farm where the museum is now, a place that was abandoned and where locals went to socialize and spend time. The museum is only open from June to August. In every other day of the year, you have to go on a guided tour on a fixed schedule.\\nReykjavík Maritime Museum\\nThe Reykjavík Maritime Museum, also known as the Víkin Maritime Museum, is near the city’s port, inside an old fish processing factory built in 1947, which was converted to house the museum. The factory’s activity was suspended in 1985 and the building was abandoned for 20 years. The building was then renovated, turned into a museum by the city, and opened to the public in 2005 as one of the five sites of the Reykjavik City Museum. Between 2007 and 2008 a top floor was added. The exhibitions at the museum are split into three parts: History of Sailing, From Poverty to Abundance, telling the story of the country’s fishermen, and The Coast Guard Vessel Óðinn, the museum’s main attraction. The museum also organizes temporary exhibitions regularly.\\nIcelandic Phallological Museum\\nThe Icelandic Phallological Museum houses a collection of precisely what’s crossing your mind: phalluses, or penises of several animals. The collection contains 280 phalluses of 93 different animal species, including whales, which are represented through 55 phalluses. The museum opened in 1997, founded by Sigurður Hjartarson, and is managed today by his son. In 2011 it received its first human donation, but the surgical removal wasn’t a success and didn’t produce a specimen worth displaying. Currently, there are three donors, who will gift their penises to the museum collection after they die. One of them is North-American actor Jonah Falcon, who’s known for his legendary sized penis. As with many other places in Iceland, the museum is only open in the summers, from early May to late August.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Enjoy a local coffee shop or a restaurant to have your delicious injera.\\nMost of the population in Addis Ababa is Christian, which generates a wonderful atmosphere. The cultural fusion is intense, with churches side by side with mosques and Christian practices with a local cultural twist.\\nVisit In Addis Ababa\\nThe History of Ethiopia contributes to the fascinating environment of Addis Ababa: we’re at the capital of the only African country that was never colonized, even though it was occupied for some time by Italians during the Mussolini period. In addition to that, it went through a communist period with the support of the Soviet Union and Cuba, which added another historical layer.\\nAddis Ababa has excellent museums and fascinating markets, especially the Merkato, which is considered the largest market in the African continent. There are many Historical Places To Visit In Ethiopia, but you do have to spend one of two full days around the capital.\\nIf you want to visit Addis Ababa soon, this list of best places will help you organize where to go.\\nBest Places to Visit in Addis Ababa\\nMerkato Market\\nMerkato Market\\nMerkato Market\\nSome claim it’s the largest market in Africa and it’s a must-see place if you like to visit markets. It looks chaotic, but there’s actually some order in it, with separate areas for each product category, including a section for products made with recycled materials. Merkato, an Italian name, replaced an older market that took place in the center of the city close to St. George church, where it is now the Town Hall. When Italy took over Ethiopia in the 1930s, authorities established a segregation system, preventing locals from accessing that market and moving it to a further west part of the city and calling it Merkato Indigino (Indigenous Market).\\nMount Entoto\\nMount Entoto is 3,250 meters above sea level, with great views over the city from its top. A visit to the mountain is a great way to spend a day in the Ethiopian capital. It’s a very picturesque place, first at the bottom of the hill with lots of people: street vendors, people coming down the mountain with firewood, animals, colorful buses. Then, you can climb to the top either on foot or public transportation, to a beautiful natural landscape, full of fresh air. The slopes are covered in eucalyptus trees imported from Australia, and the mountain is known as the “lung of Addis.” King Menelik II founded Addis Ababa on this hill about 130 years ago. At the top of the mountain, you can visit the royal complex, the Entoto Maryam Church, and the Ethnographical Museum.\\nHoly Trinity Cathedral\\nThis Orthodox cathedral was founded in 1931 and inaugurated in 1943. Here you’ll find the tombs of Emperor Haile Selassie I and Empress Menen Asfaw, as well as the thrones from where they attended religious services. Other highlights inside include murals depicting the Holy Trinity, and the stained-glass windows with scenes from the Old and the New Testament. The cathedral also includes the Church of the Four Heavenly Creatures and a small museum of church objects. There’s a cemetery near the cathedral with the graves of the resistants to the Italian occupation and the Derg dictatorship (1974-1987), and prominent public figures such as Meles Zenawi, the Prime Minister until 2012.\\nEthnological Museum\\nEthnological Museum of Addis Ababa\\nThe Ethnological Museum of Addis Ababa is a great museum and well worth the visit. It was established in 1955 and has a collection of almost 13,000 pieces of different kinds. The museum is part of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, of the University of Addis Ababa, and it’s located at the campus in a building that was once the palace of Emperor Haile Selassie. The exhibitions are diverse and scattered across two floors, displaying objects about rites of passage, wedding ceremonies, the life of different tribes, and philately. You can visit the quarters of the Emperor and, throughout the visit, notice the paintings and an excellent collection of photos by two Dutch diplomats who visited in the early 20th century. In front of the building, there’s a strange monument built by the Italians, and that depicts the rise of Ethiopia during the fascist government. The Museum is open every day, except on holidays.\\nNational Museum\\nNational Museum of Ethiopia\\nThe National Museum of Ethiopia is located in Arada Kifle Ketema, near the Technology School of the University of Addis Ababa. It was founded in 1936 when the first museum exhibition of Ethiopia opened to the public. The current museum, however, is the result of the work done by the Institute of Archaeology, founded in 1958. The museum’s most important piece is the remains of Lucy, an Australopithecus that lived 3.2 million years ago and it’s the oldest trace ever found of human ancestors. However, the original fossils aren’t on display. In the museum, you can visit the best art collection in Ethiopia and a lot of archaeological findings. On the second floor, you can visit the ethnographical collection. Apart from the exhibition dedicated to Lucy, the informative texts and captions are poor. Fortunately, there are guides who speak English showing the exhibits to foreign tourists. They work for free, but a tip, in the end, is expected.\\nMausoleum of Menelik II\\nThis mausoleum is known as Te’eka Negist and includes the tombs of Menelik II (the Emperor of Abyssinia from 1889 to 1910) and Ivasu II, as well as the tombs of Empresses Zweditu and Taytu, and Archbishop Matewos. It’s located inside the Palace of Menelik II, which is currently used as the official residence and the office of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. When in 1990 the remains of Emperor Haile Selassie were recovered, they stayed here temporarily. The mausoleum was built between 1917 and 1927 by German architect Carl Härtel. There’s a small exhibition with thrones, pictures, and various objects. The first floor is a church, Beata Maryam, where you’ll find paintings depicting important moments in the life of Menelik II. The mausoleum is open every day except on Mondays. You can photograph inside but it’s strictly forbidden to use cameras outside.\\nSt. George Cathedral\\nSt. George Cathedral\\nThis Orthodox cathedral was built by Emperor Menelik II to celebrate his victory over an Italian army in Adwa, on 1 March 1896. St. George is connected to this victory after the Ethiopians carried his relics and images to the conflict area. In addition to that, the battle happened on St. George’s day. The temple was built on the ruins of an old church that was there since the 15th century. The octagonal-shaped dome is one of the symbols of Addis Ababa, and you can see it practically from anywhere in the city. Inside, highlights include the décor by Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle and the small museum. This is where Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned in 1930. The Italians burned down the cathedral in 1937, rebuilt by the Ethiopians four years later after the country was finally free.\\nTiglachin Memorial\\nTiglachin Memorial\\nThis memorial is an interesting trace of Ethiopia’s socialist era. It was built by the order of Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was the president of Ethiopia from 1977 to 1987. The memorial honors the Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers who fought in the Ogaden War, caused by territorial disputes, between Ethiopia and Somalia. Thanks to Cuban intervention, the Ethiopians won the war. The monument was inaugurated on 12 September 1984, on the 10th anniversary of the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie. The statues of communist influence were a gift from North Korea, and include a red star at the top of the obelisk in the shape of a missile. On the main statue, you can see the communist hammer and sickle. The deposed emperor is represented riding a horse away from the scene of the events as the people overthrow his throne. The memorial also includes a panel with pictures of the Cuban soldiers who died in the conflict in Ogaden.\\nThe “Red Terror” Martyrs’ Memorial\\n“Red Terror” happened from 1977 to 1978 when the Military Junta of the socialist government, led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, fought the regime’s opponents. Oppression began in 1974 when the Junta overthrew emperor Haile Selassie, but it became worse from 1977 onward. This museum is dedicated to keeping the memories of those violent days alive and the victims of the regime. In addition to the exhibition, the museum is involved in historical research to develop a database of victims and identify the remains of those found in mass graves. The visit to the museum will be a heavy one considering the topic. There are free guided tours in English and some of the guides are surviving political prisoners.\\nMenelik II Square\\nThis square was built to celebrate the victory of the Ethiopians in the battle of Adwa against the Italian army on 1 March 1896, led by Emperor Menelik II. Every year the day is celebrated at the square, a day that is also the day of St. George, the patron saint of Ethiopia. The square is the starting point of all the roads in Ethiopia. In the center of the square, there’s the statue of Menelik II on a horse, holding two spears in the direction of Adwa. The statue was built in 1930 when Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned. It’s near the Town Hall, in front of the St. George Cathedral, in the heart of the city center.\\nLocal Tours in Addis Ababa\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

The memorial, appropriately, is located near the central train station from where trains departed full of those exiled people.\\nRight after the independence of Moldova, in 1990, following the fall of the Soviet Union, a temporary memorial was placed there. It was a monolith with a commemorative plaque. The definite memorial was inaugurated in 2013, a series of anthropomorphic statues walking dramatically to exile on a base made of stone. The sculpture was created in Belarus and later transported to its final destination, Chisinau.\\nCentral Market\\nThis is a market you really can’t miss. It’s one of the liveliest places in the Moldovan capital city, open from 5:00 am until late in the evening.

There are areas in this market selling handmade products and, again, the sky is the limit regarding what you can find here: shoes, clothes, electronics, cookies, preserves.\\nSmall producers and vendors are particularly impressive, including people who have no more than a hand full of tomatoes or a couple of celery sticks from their gardens to sell, or old people who try to earn a few Leis with clothes they don’t need anymore.\\nWhen browsing the food area don’t forget that tasting is part of the experience and so is bargaining when you find something you’d like to buy.\\nWater Tower\\nThe Water Tower is on the way from the city center to the popular Valea Morilor Park. It’s a classic structure built at the end of the 19th century and designed by Alexander Bernadazzi. It was once an essential part of the city’s water supply system. The top, made of wood, was destroyed in an earthquake and rebuilt between 1980 and 1983 into what you see today.\\nThe tower is mainly made of stone and some brick and it’s 22 meters high. Inside there’s a spiral staircase that was later complemented with an elevator. For a while, this tower was the headquarters of the History Museum of Chisinau.\\nValea Morilor Park\\nThis spacious urban park is within walking distance from the city center.

It was built in 1830 by orders of the New Russia governor, Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov.

During the Soviet era, all religious activities were forbidden and the building was used as a venue for cultural events and shows.\\nIt’s a very austere-looking cathedral, both outside and inside. The six Doric columns are the top feature of the main façade, and behind it, you can see the dome covered in zinc that was added in 1997. There are three altars devoted to three saints inside.\\nAlley of Classics\\nThe Alley of Classics is a pathway at the Stefan cel Mare park in the center of Chisinau. Here, among leafy trees and a lot of vegetation, you’ll see several busts depicting the great names of the Romanian and Moldovan literature.\\nIt’s 28 statues in total, placed in alphabetical order, including a renowned foreigner, Alexander Pushkin, at one of the ends of the Alley. While the other busts are made of red granite, Pushkin’s is a bronze statue by Russian sculptor Alexander Opekushin.\\nThe bust collection was created in 1958 but included only 12 sculptures until the independence of Moldova in 1990. The new government decided to add some of the best-known Romanian literary figures that had been excluded by the Soviet authorities, inspired by an identical series of busts in the Cismigiu Park in Bucharest.\\nStreet Markets\\nWhat Chisinau lacks in great monuments and museums it compensates with authentic markets and the genuine city life you can experience there.\\nThe Flower Market, open from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm, is considered to be one of the most charming flower markets in Europe, stretching alongside the northwest side of the Cathedral Park, in a sea of color and fragrances.\\nArts Square is the right place to buy a souvenir from Moldova.

The small collection includes different military pieces, photographs, documents, and medals.\\nOutside you can see some of the larger pieces like planes and war tanks made in Russia.\\nThe section dedicated to the repression during the Soviet Union era is impressive but most of the legends are not in English.

It was built recently, in 2008, on a site where there was only a simple place of prayer. The dream of the local community to build a mosque there began in the 1950s when they founded an association to carry on the plan. The Mohammad Al-Amin Association couldn’t buy the land they needed, and the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1991) put their plans on hold. The mosque began construction in 2002 with a donation from then Prime-Minister Rafik Hariri. It’s near the Martyrs’ Square and it’s quite an impressive building in amber-colored stone, with four 65-meter tall minarets, and spacious enough to accommodate 3,700 followers, and possibly just as many in the side hall for the women.\\nRoman Baths\\nRoman Baths\\nThe ruins of the Roman Baths are in the historic center of Beirut surrounded by the modern Lebanese government buildings. They were discovered in 1968 and went under preservation works after the end of the Lebanese Civil War. Today, it’s used as a venue for some artistic performances and events. The Roman city of Berytus had four bath complexes, sophisticatedly equipped with systems for cold and hot baths. Nowadays, it also includes a Mediterranean garden with medicinal plants that Romans used in the bath water.\\nThe Maronite Cathedral of St. George\\nThe Maronite Cathedral of St. George\\nThis Neo-Classical cathedral in the historic center of Beirut was built between 1884 and 1894, inspired by the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. Monsignor Joseph Debs, the Archbishop of Beirut, was the man behind the plan to build it in a location where there had previously been a church dedicated to the same saint in 1755. Engineer Antoun Tabet led the renovation works in 1954. It was severely damaged during the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1991) and restored again in 1997. The new bell tower that took ten years to be completed was inaugurated in 2016. The original bell tower was 76 meters high, like the one in Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, but the new structure is 72 meters tall, the same height as the minarets of the Mohammed Al Amin mosque to convey the sentiment of inter-religious unity. There is a small museum you can visit in the crypt.\\nMartyrs’ Square\\nMartyrs’ Square\\nThis spacious public area was named Martyrs’ Square in 1931 as a tribute to the Lebanese independentists who were executed by the Ottomans, although it’s existed in different sizes and shapes since at least the 18th century. In the 1950s, when Lebanon and Beirut were at their prime, the square was full of cafes and cultural spaces becoming the city’s gathering place. Unfortunately, during the Civil War, it was right in the middle of the opposing sides and was severely damaged. The square was only recovered in 2005 after a public call to revitalize the space.\\nRené Moawad Garden\\nThese gardens are one of the oldest public spaces of this kind in Beirut. They were created in the Ottoman period, in 1907, by orders of Khalil Pasha, an Ottoman military officer. Since then, the gardens have changed names several times. First, it was called Hamidi Public Garden, although people called it Sanayeh Garden because it’s located in this neighborhood. The current name is a tribute to president René Moawad, who was assassinated in 1989 near the garden. You can rent a bike by the south gate. During the Lebanon War in 2006, the garden was a gathering place for refugees and the centers that helped them.\\nMuseums in Beirut\\nRobert Mouawad Private Museum\\nThis private museum holds a rich collection of jewels, furniture, and antiques. It was founded by Robert Mouawad and it’s located in the house of Henri Philippe Pharaoun, a Lebanese politician and art collector. The Neo-Gothic building itself is worth a visit, but the exhibitions are bound to impress visitors as well because of the diverse pieces on display that includes the first Koran printed in Germany and the Victoria’s Secret bra wore by Heidi Klum. The collection seems inconsistent thanks to Robert Mouawad’s penchant for collecting anything that he found interesting and that he could buy, regardless of what it was. It’s, therefore, a very diverse museum.\\nNational Museum of Beirut\\nDespite its ambitious name, the National Museum holds only archaeological findings, which abound in Lebanon. It only opened in 1942 inside an Egyptian Revival style building but the collection dates back to the First World War (1914-1918). Only 1,300 of the 100,000 pieces owned by the museum are on display. Despite the damage to the museum during the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1991, the collection was put in a safe place in time. After the war was over, the new government’s Ministry of Culture and Education decided to reinvest in the museum, which reopened in 1997. It’s in the area of Mazra now and it’s a must-visit for anyone traveling to Lebanon. You’ll see the most beautiful pieces found in the many archaeological sites in the country, namely Byblos and Baalbek.\\nSursock Museum\\nOfficially known as the Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock Museum, it’s a modern and contemporary art museum located in a beautiful and typical Lebanese urban palace from the early 20th century, built in a style influenced by the Ottoman and Venetian architecture. The museum started with the private collection of aristocrat Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock, who declared in his will that we wanted his house and private art collection to become a museum. That happened in 1952 and in 1961 the Sursock Museum opened for the first time, a one of a kind event that stirred the Lebanese cultural activity. The museum was later expanded and reopened in 2015 with 8,500 square meters and better support infrastructures. The museum is located in a street with other beautiful manors from the same period.  \\nMIM Museum\\nThis is a private museum started by Salim Eddé that focuses on minerals, located near the Saint Joseph University and the National Museum. It’s named after the 24th letter in the Arabic alphabet, which is the first letter of the words museum, minerals, and mines. It’s housed in a modern building and the collection includes over 2,000 minerals from 70 countries. It opened in 2013 and it’s considered one of the best museums in the field, well-curated using modern techniques.

Despite that, you can still see some quirky streets.\\nCenter Havana: it’s a good option with fewer tourists and more picturesque. It’s in the area around Old Havana, alongside the coastline. I recommend you stay here at a house at the Malecon, for example.\\nVedado: although it’s not exactly new, this part of the city is not within walking distance from the city center but it’s not that far geographically. It’s a more cosmopolitan area with more cultural events.\\nTours in Havana\\nHavana City Guide\\nCastle of Royal Force\\nCastle of Royal Force\\nCastillo de la Fuerza Real (Castle of Royal Force) was built between 1558 and 1577 on top of a previous fortress that was severely damaged during an attack by French corsairs. It’s one of the oldest forts in America. Its four-point plan it’s typical of the Renaissance military engineering and it inherited some of the features of Spanish castles from the Middle Ages. Speaking in military terms, the building was a fiasco. It was too small to be practical and too far away from the Bay of Havana to prevent enemy ships from entering. Thus, it was used as the governor’s official residence, with several modifications over time. The National Archive was established here from 1899 onward, and the National Library from 1938 to 1957. After the 1959 Revolution, it became the headquarters of a department that supervised the museums, later there was an attempt to create a military museum, and finally, in 2010, it became the Maritime Museum.\\nHavana Cathedral\\nOutside Havana Cathedral\\nInside Havana Cathedral\\nThe Havana Cathedral is in the historic center of the city, at Cathedral Square, one of the most picturesque squares in the Cuban capital. The full name of the church in Spanish is La Catedral de la Virgen María de la Concepción Inmaculada de La Habana. It was finished in 1777 and the predominant style is Baroque with Tuscan influences. It has two bell towers, the one on the right is wider as is usual in typical Baroque religious buildings. The Jesuits were in charge of the construction, who, ironically, were ousted from the island by King Charles III ten years before the church was finished. The interior is richly decorated but the frescoes are copies from others you’ll find in Italian churches.\\nCastillo del Morro (Morro Castle)\\nAlso known as Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro, the Morro Castle was built in the mid-18th century and designed by Italian military architect Juan Bautista Antonelli. It was put to the test for the first time in a conflict in 1762, with extremely poor results. It was under siege and taken by the English. Nowadays, the castle is worth the visit not just to see the interior but also for the exhibitions like the one dedicated to the lighthouses of Cuba. If you don’t want to pay the admission fee or you are visiting outside of the opening hours, you can still visit the exterior and see some of the gorgeous views over Havana.\\nNational Capitol Building\\nThe National Capitol Building of Havana was built between 1926 and 1929 and housed the Cuban Congress until it was dissolved following the 1959 Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro. The Neo-Classical and Art Nouveau building was designed by Eugenio Rayneri Piedra and inspired by the Capitol in Washington, but the dome is based on the one at the Paris Pantheon. Inside you can visit the third largest statue inside of a building in the world, Italian Angelo Zanelli’s Statue of the Republic. For a long time, the Capitol was used as the headquarters of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Development but it’s being prepared to house the National Assembly of Cuba again.\\nChrist of Havana\\nChrist of Havana\\nThe statue of the Christ of Havana is at the top of La Cabaña hill, across the bay, near Casablanca. The statue was made by Cuban sculptor Jilma Madera and inaugurated on Christmas Eve of 1958. It’s made of white marble and 20 meters tall, placed on a pedestal with about 3 meters. She used 67 blocks of marble imported from Italy, which were blessed by Pope Pius XII. Fifteen days after the statue’s inauguration, Fidel Castro marched into Havana leading his revolutionary army. To visit the statue, take the ferry across the bay from Havana to Casablanca.\\nPaseo del Prado\\nPaseo del Prado, also known by its new name Paseo de Martí, begins near the Capitol building and stretches alongside the sea in front of the San Salvador de la Punta Castle. This street that works as the border between Centro Habana (Center Havana) and Habana Vieja (Old Havana) was originally designed in 1772 by Don Felipe Fonsdeviela y Ondeano. In 1925 it was redesigned by French Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier to include the trees and marble benches you can see there today. Magnificent buildings flank the avenue, some of them quite neglected while others are well-preserved like Hotel Sevilla. Wealthy and privileged people began to move from here to other neighborhoods like Miramar or Vedado long before Castro’s Cuban Revolution.\\nLa Bodeguita del Medio\\nLa Bodeguita del Medio is a historic bar and restaurant in Cuba. There was a small grocery store here called Bodega La Complaciente and the owner, Ángel Martínez, began selling meals to his clients in 1942. One day, Leandro Garcia, a well-known Cuban journalist, decided to write his name on one of the walls and, of course, other customers followed suit. Over time, the small grocery store grew to become the bar you see today. Famous customers included Brigitte Bardot, Salvador Allende, Fidel Castro, and Ernest Hemingway who loved coming here for the mojitos and who made this place famous. La Bodeguita del Medio allegedly created those mojitos. And where did the name officially adopted in 1950 come from? Felito Ayon, an influential editor in Havana, accidentally named it because that’s how he described the place to friends asking for directions. La Bodeguita del Media means the store in the middle in English. Nowadays it is mostly a tourist trap where you won’t likely find a genuine Cuban.\\nPlaza Vieja (Old Square)\\nPlaza Vieja in Havana\\nThe Old Square competes with the Cathedral Square for the tile of central meeting point in Old Havana, but this one is larger and livelier. Ironically, it was called New Square when it was built in 1759. But new became old and it’s now a square lined with widespread architectural heritage. In the 18th century, an important market took place here and the square was called Plaza del Mercado (Market Square). After a new market was built at Plaza del Cristo in 1814, it began to be known as Old Square. It was a venue for bullfights, public executions, and selling slaves. Nowadays it’s a mix of a tourist spot, with high-priced bars and restaurants catering to foreigners, and a local hang out. Most of the buildings around the square are historical, housing museums and other cultural institutions. All of them have been restored and include a short historical explanation.\\nReal Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás (Partagás Cigar Factory)\\nCigars are one of the most popular products in Havana and tourists always enjoy visiting a factory of “puros” (pure in Spanish, which designates a cigar made with tobacco from only one country). The Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás is the most iconic and most visited by tourists, located in the center of Havana near the Capitol. The factory was founded in 1845 by Spanish Jaime Partagás, who died shortly after and passed on the company to Ramon Cifuentes, who focused on growing the company. In the 20th century, the building was expanded with a second floor and warehouses. Nowadays it employs 400 people who roll tobacco leaves for 12-hour shifts to make the famous Cohiba and Montecristo cigars. You can visit the factory and the tour in English costs 10 Euros.\\nThe Malecon\\nMalecon avenue water effect in Havana\\nThe Malecon, which means “seaside avenue” in Spanish, starts near the San Salvador de la Punta Castle, alongside the Caribbean Sea for about 8 km. Its construction began in 1901 when the USA administered the island, and you can see a plaque marking the occasion at the beginning of the avenue. It’s the place where locals go to for sports, fishing, dating, play some music, or just relax. It’s a social gathering place where you go to meet locals who are always ready to chat. Beware of the ocean, though. When the sea is rough, waves are big enough to reach the buildings on the other side of the six-lane avenue.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

You can see a bit of the Mediterranean joy in the colors of the city’s medina. Full of personality, the old Medina of Tunis is an excellent place to spend time exploring the gorgeous maze-like streets and the souvenir shops. Between the 12th and 16th centuries, Tunis was one of the wealthiest cities in the world. The over 700 monuments, palaces, mosques, mausoleums, and fountains are a sign of the city’s prosperous past and of the mix of Andalusian, Hafsid, and Ottoman influences. The Medina of Tunis began to build around the Al-Zaytuna Mosque in the 7th century, today the center of the Medina. The city was vital in the Muslim universe until the 16th century.\\nAl-Zaytuna Mosque\\nAl-Zaytuna Mosque is the main mosque in the old Medina of Tunis and also the oldest mosque in the city.

Construction began in 1893 and it was inaugurated on Christmas in 1897.\\nBab el Bhar Gate\\nThe massive Bab el Bahr Gate, at Victory Square, is one of the main monuments in Tunis. The Victory Square marks the separation between the new part of the city and the old part of the city, the medina.\\nSidi Bou Said\\nSidi Bou Said is 20 km from Tunis on the Mediterranean coast. The town has always been linked to the arts since the early 13th century when Abu Said el Baji, an influential Sufi professor, moved here. Since then, the town has attracted many foreign and Tunisian artists. It’s, in fact, an extraordinary place because it’s located on a high point with all houses on the hillside near the sea.\\nIt’s a charming scenery with the Andalusian and Arabic style houses with white walls and contrasting blue doors and windows, lining narrow streets and staircases. When walking this maze, visit the Palace Dar el-Annabi. The former house of a wealthy merchant in the 17th century is now an ethnographic museum depicting the daily lives of the town people.\\nPlace du Gouvernement\\nSome of the important Tunisian government buildings are located in Place du Gouvernement, opposite the Bab el Bahr Gate.\\nYoussef Dey Mosque\\nBuilt in 1612 by Youssef Dey, this mosque is one of the prettiest monuments in the city. The Youssef Dey Mosque is located in the Kasbah district, near the Government Palace also known as Dar El Bey. You can’t miss this place when visiting the medina.\\n18th-century Tunisian Palaces\\nThere are a lot of palaces in the Medina of Tunis.

This city with over 16 million people stretches alongside the East shore of the Nile River, and it’s the largest city of the Middle East and Africa. From its many viewpoints, we have exceptional views over the river and neighboring valleys, and the dry desert.\\nCairo is a city that carries us to legends lost in time. We can’t speak of Cairo without thinking of the Pharaohs. It’s such a massive city that it’s hard to figure out what to visit first. Of course, when we talk about this Arab city, we can’t forget to mention three main sites: the pyramids, the Nile River, and the Egyptian Museum.\\nCairo the capital of Egypt\\nCairo’s population is mainly Muslim, and as in any Muslim country, you must respect their traditions and customs. Cairo’s main tourist attraction is the Great Pyramids of Giza, but the city possesses many more heritage sites beyond that. An itinerary of this city should also include the Al-Azhar Mosque, the fabulous Egyptian Museum built in 1857, the Coptic Museum, and the Museum of Islamic Art.\\nCairo Top 5\\nGiza Pyramid Complex\\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\\nKhan al Khalili\\nCairo Museum\\nCity of the Dead\\nWhat to visit in Cairo\\nMost famous sites\\nEgyptian Museum\\nKhan al Khalili Neighborhood\\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\\nAl Azhar Park\\nGiza Necropolis\\nFunerary Complex of Djoser\\nThe Hanging Church\\nCoptic Museum\\nMosque of Ibn Tulun\\nMosque of Sultan Hassan\\nTahrir Square\\nBen Ezra Synagogue\\nCity of the Dead\\nCairo Tower\\nBab Zuweila\\nAl Hussein Mosque\\nSaint Barbara Church\\nAl-Hakim Mosque\\nManial Palace\\nGayer-Anderson Museum\\nEl Seheimy House\\nAbdeen Palace\\nMuseum of Islamic Ceramics\\nAl Aqmar Mosque\\nBab Al Nasr\\nMuseum Mukhtar\\nBeshtak Palace\\nAqsunqur Mosque\\nMap of Attractions\\nTours in Cairo\\nCairo City Guide\\nGiza Necropolis\\nView of the Pyramids of Giza dating back from Ancient Egypt\\nThe Giza Necropolis, also known as the Giza Pyramid Complex, is an archaeological site at the Giza plateau on the outskirts of Cairo. This complex is formed by three sets of pyramids, commonly known as the Great Pyramids, the impressive and massive Great Sphinx, several cemeteries, a small town where artisans and workers used to live, and the industrial area. It’s in the middle of the desert, a half-hour drive from Cairo. It’s one of the oldest great wonders of the world, remarkably well-preserved, and clear evidence of the greatness of both the New Empire and Ancient Egypt. The main pyramids are Giza or Cheops, Chephren, and the Pyramids of Mykerinus. They are the graves of Kings Cheops, Chephren, and Mykerinus, father, son, and grandson respectively. These are the most famous monuments in the world, which make a lot of people wonder how they could make such spectacular constructions at that time. Math and engineering had to be quite advanced to result in such breathtaking buildings.\\nThe Great Sphinx\\nGreat Sphinx of Giza\\nThe Great Sphynx is a massive statue made of limestone at the Giza Necropolis archaeological site. The mythological creature with the body of a lion and a human head sits on the Giza Plateau, on the shore of the Nile River. Most archaeologists believe the statue’s face depicts Pharaoh Chephren. It’s the most massive statue in the world carved on a monolith, with 74 meters in length and about 20 in height. This gigantic statue was buried under desert sand up to the lion’s shoulders. Thutmose IV in 1400 BC ordered the statue to be unearthed until the lion’s front paws, but with no success. Later, Ramses II the Great also tried to do it, but unsuccessfully. In the 19th century, archaeologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia managed to uncover the sphynx’s chest completely and in the 1930s Émile Baraize led a team in charge of digging the whole monument.\\nFunerary Complex of Djoser\\nThe Funerary Complex of Djoser, known as the Pyramid of Djoser or the Pyramid of Saqqara, was built as a grave for Pharaoh Djoser by his vizier or royal architect Imhotep. This pyramid was built in the 27th century BC at the Necropolis of Saqqara, near what’s known today as the city of Memphis. The building is massive and is full of ceremonial décor elements which make it even more appealing. Archaeologists are sure this was the first pyramid ever built in Egypt, which they can tell by the revisions made to the building as construction progressed. The pyramid was seen as a temple where the Pharaoh could rest and carry on his work after death.\\nCairo Citadel\\nIt’s no surprise that the Cairo Citadel is one of the sites in Cairo that most appeal to tourists and Egypt enthusiasts. Being here is indeed a once in a lifetime experience. This city was the headquarters of the Egyptian government for almost 1,000 years, founded in 1176 by Saladin, a Muslim. The citadel is organized into three sectors, the main one in the south where you can see the 19th-century Mosque of Muhammad Ali and the Al-Nasir Muhammad Mosque. This medieval Islamic fortress in Cairo is an open-air museum and a historic site with museums and monuments (mostly mosques), with gorgeous views of the city.\\nSaladin said “with one wall I will build two cities, Cairo and Fustat,” as a way to better defend the land. That way it was hard to attack the main government center, which explains why they stayed here until the end of the 19th century. Some call it Muhammad Ali Citadel because of the mosque with the same name at the top. Because the name is an attention-grabber, it became popular to call it like that. Must-visits here include the Al-Gawhara Palace Museum, Carriage Museum, Military Museum, and Police Museum.\\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\\nThe Mosque of Muhammad Ali at the Cairo Citadel is a monument commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the 19th century to honor his first-born son who died very young. It’s an Ottoman-style mosque at the top of the citadel that you can see from anywhere in Cairo.\\nThe monument is absolutely stunning. It’s one of the main tourist attractions in the city, which, together with the Cairo Citadel, is visited by thousands of tourists every year. Architect Yusuf Bushnak was inspired by the style of the Yeni Mosque in Istanbul. The main dome is encircled by four smaller domes and four semicircular domes.\\nThis limestone mosque is square (41×41 meters), the main dome is 21 meters high, and the building is 52 meters high in total. It has two cylindric minarets on the west side, both with balconies and 82 meters tall.\\nKhan al Khalili Neighborhood\\nKhan el Khalili started as a commercial area and turned into a residential neighborhood for the merchants and their families. It’s organized like a massive market, with narrow winding streets where you can find thousands of stalls selling all kinds of products. The streets are always busy and crowded. In addition to coming here to buy all you need, you can also come here just for tea, socialize at cafes, attend concerts, or even take part in a crafts workshop.\\nThis is one of the most prestigious commercial centers in Cairo. You can find anything here from shoes to fabrics, spices, jewels, perfume, food, and souvenirs. In Arabic, it’s called a souk, which means bazaar or market, and all Islamic societies have one with the same features and different sizes. The smell of spices, hurried people walking down the streets, and the colors of fabrics flowing are common to all markets. It’s always a memorable experience.\\nTahrir Square\\nTahrir Square, or Liberation Square in English, is the largest public square in the center of the Egyptian capital, Cairo. It was first called Ismail Square, in honor of Pasha Ismail, the Viceroy who ruled in the 19th century and was responsible for many of the architectural projects that preserved and improved the city. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the country was no longer a constitutional monarchy and became a republic. At that time, the square’s name was changed to Midan al-Tahrir or Liberation Square. Some of the most important buildings are located around this square, such as the Egyptian Museum, the old campus of the American University, the Sadat metro station, and government sites like the Mogamma building and the former headquarter of the National Democratic Party of Hosni Mubarak. At this square, important events happened that would change the course of History for Cairo and the country: the Bread Riots (1977), the protests against the War of Iraq (March 2003), and, more recently, the Arab Spring, the revolution that took down president Mubarak.\\nCity of the Dead\\nThe City of the Dead is a cemetery on the lowlands of Mokattam Hills, southeast of Cairo. Locals call it Al’Arafa, which means The Cemetery. You can see how burying the dead here is quite different from the Western tradition. The tombs are a sort of house where family members can spend 40 days with the deceased and grieve. However, things got a bit out of hand here, and people stayed for a lot more than 40 days. It’s considered the largest necropolis in the world, with about one million people living inside the cemetery. Some people live inside the tombs, while others built houses around the cemetery. I know it’s hard to believe, but you have every facility you need to live a normal life, including bakeries, cafes, and schools. Although huge, the city of the dead is more of a village. Locals here are impoverished and live without electricity and drinking water, with all the socio-economic issues that arise from that situation.\\nEgyptian Museum\\nThe Egyptian Museum is the most important institution and museum in Egypt. At this center in the country’s capital city, Cairo, there are over 120,000 pieces from Ancient Egypt found over the years, especially since the archaeological works that began in the 19th century. This museum was inaugurated in 1858 with pieces donated by French archaeologist Auguste Mariette. A few years later the museum library was established and immediately became the most important archive of Ancient Egypt’s civilization studies. The museum also houses the treasure of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.\\nThe Cairo Egyptian Museum is impressive and the countless pieces of Ancient Egypt will completely blow your mind in just a few hours. In the 19th century, the Egyptian government built this museum to preserve and save the treasures of Ancient Egypt. At the time, Egyptian monuments were constantly looted and the government had just forbidden the export of archaeological findings. The two-floor building inaugurated in 1902 is in the city center, in the heart of Cairo.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

He wrote down “Monte vide eu” (“I saw a mount”) when referring to the mount in Montevideo. But, although there aren’t any records of this, other sources suggest the name might be an acronym for “Monte VI De Este a Oeste” (“I saw a mount from east to west”). You can’t visit Uruguay and not spend some time in Montevideo. Otherwise, you’ll be missing out on a fascinating destination.\\nAlmost half the population of Uruguay lives in the capital Montevideo. Its historic center dates back to 1724 when the city was founded. In the mid-19th century, the city grew towards the east and an area now known as the Centro was born.

But when walking towards the northeast, you’ll enter a completely different world, with modern shopping malls and communities that remind us of the beach areas of Miami or Rio de Janeiro.\\nMontevideo gained city status in 1726 and was very disputed between Portuguese, Spanish, and English. Conquered by the Portuguese in 1817, it became the capital city of the Cisplatina Province of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves in 1821. It became independent in 1828, as the capital city of Uruguay.

To reach there, or any of the suggested accommodations, from the bus station you can catch a taxi (about UYU 150 / 5 Eur), a city bus (UYU 28 / 1 Eur), or walk. It’s about 3.5 km away.\\nAt Independence Square you can visit Salvo Palace, definitely the most famous building in Montevideo and that, surprisingly, was once the tallest in Latin America.\\nYou’ll enter the old city through the Puerta de la Ciudadela (Old Town Gate).\\nYou might want to visit the Legislative Palace and the Cementerio Central (Central Cemetery). You can walk to both sites.\\nThe well-preserved Solís Theater is right next to Independence Square, where you can go on guided tours to know more about the building’s history and its halls or attend some artistic performances;\\nWalking or riding a bicycle on the Rambla of Montevideo is a pleasant activity, especially when the sun is setting at the Plata River.\\nIf you don’t mind sleeping in a dorm, Caballo Loco Hostel is a great option. It’s not cheap, but the location and quality are worth it. If you value your privacy, I suggest Chez Mario et Solange. It has excellent ratings and is located in the best area of the city.\\nIf you’d like to see some museums, visit the Museum of National History scattered through four historical houses in the city, all of them with free entrance.\\nAcross the bay, a bit further from the center, you can visit the fortress Fortaleza General Artigas, also known as Fortaleza del Cerro, Montevideo’s historical center with excellent views over the whole city.\\nThe Pocitos neighborhood, cosmopolitan and with a long beach, has a pleasant vibe and it’s very safe. It’s also a great starting point for a walk on the Rambla, the seaside promenade that’s a locals’ favorite and always vibrant.\\nAfter a few days in Montevideo, you’ll want to visit Buenos Aires but before that take a trip to Colonia Sacramento. This small city is a must-see not only for its atmosphere but because it was founded by Portuguese, which is rare in Spanish-speaking America.\\nThere are bus connections from Montevideo to Colonia that depart every hour from bus terminal Tres Cruces. The trip is about three hours and costs around UYU 345 / 11.60 EUR.\\nMontevideo Top 5\\nPlaza Independencia\\nMontevideo Fortress\\nMontevideo Legislative Palace\\nPuerta de la Ciudadela\\nMercado del Puerto\\nWhat to visit in Montevideo\\nMost famous sites\\nPlaza Independencia\\nFortaleza del Cerro\\nLegislative Palace\\nConstitution Square\\nPuerta de la Ciudadela\\nMercado del Puerto\\nMontevideo Cathedral\\nSolís Theater\\nPocitos Beach\\nPalacio Salvo\\nLock Fountain\\nMirador De La Intendencia\\nObelisk of Montevideo\\nPeatonal Sarandí Street\\nArtigas Mausoleum\\nPalacio Taranco\\nTorres García Museum\\nPalacio Estévez\\nMap of Attractions\\nTours in Montevideo\\nMontevideo City Guide\\nPlaza Independencia (Independence Square)\\nThe Independence Square marks the connection between the historic center of Montevideo and its functional center. It was established in 1836 when the old fortresses on the site were destroyed. At Independence Square, you’ll find some of the most iconic elements of the Uruguayan capital such as the Salvo Palace and the monument to General José Artigas, whose remains rest in the mausoleum under the equestrian statue. There you’ll also see the Solís Theater, the Estévez Palace, and the Torre Ejecutiva, a modern presidential palace that you can partially visit. Cars aren’t allowed at Ciudad Vieja (Old Town), where you enter through Puerta de la Ciudadela (Old Town Gate), so Independence Square is the historic center’s connection to the rest of the city, with lots of people and buses.\\nFortaleza del Cerro\\nFortaleza del Cerro\\nFortaleza del Cerro, also known as Fortaleza General José Artigas, is a fortress at the Casabó neighborhood, west of Villa del Cerro, with an amazing view of the old city and the Montevideo Bay. It was built between 1809 and 1811 to protect the city from the English menace, and was the setting for battles during the Independence War and the internal conflicts that followed. From then onwards, the fortress only shoots a salute when important ships enter Montevideo. It was restored between 1931 and 1939 and now houses the José Artigas Museum, open Wednesday to Sunday.\\nSolís Theater\\nThe most important theater of Uruguay is at Independence Square between the old city and the city’s functional center. A first draft of the theater was designed by Italian architect Carlo Zucchi and that was the base for Francisco Xavier Garmendia to bring the building to life. It was inaugurated on 25 August 1856 in the presence of the President of the Republic, Gabriel Antonio Pereira, and the opera Ernani by Verdi was performed on the opening night. Surprisingly, the inauguration happened before the theater was finished and the side wings weren’t completed before 1874. In the following years, the theater was improved and expanded, but the Italian influence remained. The Neo-Classical façade seems to be based on the concept used on the Carlo Felice Theater in Genoa and the concert hall is very similar to the one at the La Scala in Milan.\\nMontevideo Metropolitan Cathedral\\nMontevideo Metropolitan Cathedral\\nThis church, the main church in Montevideo and Uruguay, is near the Constitution Square. It’s relatively new, built on the site where there once was the Mother Church, initially constructed in 1720 and partially destroyed in 1788. There are no records of the construction process of the new church, but it was most likely designed by Portuguese military engineer José Custódio de Sá e Faria. It was inaugurated in 1804 before it was complete. From that moment onward, it withstood bizarre events starting with being shot in 1807 by English ships entering the Plata River. The two towers were finished in 1818 and the church was renovated in 1858 by architect Bernardo Poncini. The church is linked to some great moments in the national History, as this was the place where the first flag of Uruguay was blessed and the first Constitution was made official.\\nPalacio Estévez (Estévez Palace)\\nIn 1873, Francisco Candelario Estévez bought the land where you can now see the palace finished in 1874. The owner lived there and leased part of his property to the Consulate of Italy. Four years later, the palace became the property of Bank of London y Río de la Plata and after that of the state. President Lorenzo Latorre decided to turn the palace into the Seat of Government, where it remained until 1985. Soon after that, the palace was remodeled by architect Enrique Benech and artist Manuel Espínola Gómez, and since 1999 it houses the Museo de la Casa de Gobierno (Museum of the House of Government). In 2009, it officially changed its name to José Artigas Building.\\nPalacio Salvo\\nPalacio Salvo\\nSalvo Palace was built in 1928 and was at that time the tallest building in South America with 95 meters in height. It was designed by Italian architect Mario Palanti, as its twin building Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires was. Gothic is the main style of architecture with some Neo-Romantic and Classical details. When it was built, it included a lighthouse at the top as a way to impress visitors arriving in Montevideo by boat. Some fun facts about the building: it was meant to be a luxury hotel, but it never happened; it includes a music studio worth several millions of dollars and a radio station. Unfortunately, the building is slightly neglected.\\nMercado del Puerto (Port Market)\\nMercado del Puerto\\nMercado del Puerto (Port Market) was once a market, in the traditional sense, but now it’s something different, frequently described as a cultural and gastronomical journey. The building was inaugurated in 1868 by the Spanish Pedro Sáenz de Zumarán and a group of local investors. The style was markedly British and it was built by the Union Foundry, a company in Liverpool. Nowadays it’s a gathering place, especially on Saturdays, when the market hosts several artistic activities and music concerts. For meat lovers, this is a mandatory stop as one of the best places to try the famous Uruguayan steaks.\\nPeatonal Sarandí Street\\nPeatonal Sarandí Street\\nThis is the most important street in Ciudad Vieja (Old Town). It begins at the old town, crosses the Constitution Square (Plaza Constitución), and stretches all the way to the Rambla, the seaside avenue. A walk on this street usually ends at the Montevideo port pier, known as Escollera Sarandí. Iconic historical buildings alongside this street include the Pablo Fernando Building, Plaza Fuerte Hotel, Torres Garcia Museum, Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral, Libreria Más Puro Verso, and Cabildo. Cars aren’t allowed here since 1922 and the street has deep historical roots. It was designed in 1726 by Pedro Millán, who was inspired by the city planning that was trending in France at the time. There are plenty of art galleries around and this is a popular spot for street artists in Montevideo.\\nArtigas Mausoleum\\nArtigas Mausoleum\\nYou’ll notice an equestrian statue at the center of Independence Square that’s actually the mausoleum of General José Gervasio Artigas (1764-1860), the father of the Uruguayan nation, and a prominent figure of the independence war and the strengthening of the national sovereignty. The monument and the mausoleum were built in the 1930s and the national hero’s remains were transferred there. The Artigas Mausoleum is under the statue and is permanently secured by two guards of a traditional branch called Blandegues de Artigas. You can visit the mausoleum on Mondays from noon to 6:00 pm, and from Tuesdays to Sundays from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.\\nTorres García Museum\\nTorres García Museum\\nAlthough the museum was created in 1949, shortly after the passing of artist Torres Garcia, it’s only been at the current site since 1991. The idea for the museum came from the late artist’s family, driven by his widow Manolita Piña, to group Torres Garcia’s artistic and document legacy. It opened to the public in 1955, changed locations several times, and was permanently closed in 1973 during the dictatorship. After that period, a foundation was created to manage the museum and which established an important protocol with the Ministry of Culture. Today the museum is at the Old Town and showcases the work of Torres Garcia and some temporary exhibitions. It also includes a library, an area for shows and events, and several areas dedicated to workshops and other educational and cultural activities.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nVISIT KATHMANDU\\nKathmandu is the capital of Nepal, a city that was relevant to the generation who came of age between the mid-1980s and the early-1990s, influenced by the travel writings of those who came here at the beginning of the hippie movement. But today Kathmandu is a different place, for most travelers, the gateway into the country, a fascinating city with a lot of things to see that you’ll explore before going to the mountains or traveling to your next destination.\\nKathmandu has 1.5 million people and a long history behind it. No one knows precisely when the city was founded, but there are archaeological traces that reveal human occupation in the 2nd century. Since then, the city has dominated the Kathmandu Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as the capital for several dynasties and a part of the Nepali mythology.\\nDespite the damages of the devastating earthquake in 2015, its historic center is stunning. It’s a mystical city that impresses most of the westerner travelers. Kathmandu is the base to explore the rest of Nepal, where ancient temples stand out in the middle of the busy city, with all the amenities a traveler could wish for.\\nQuick travel tips to visit Kathmandu:\\nWake up early and be the first at monuments, museums, or other points of interest;\\nIf you only have time to visit one temple, make it the Pashupatinath Temple;\\nPatan is another city but very close to Kathmandu. Don’t skip visiting it;\\nThe Monkey Temple (Swayambhunath) is a must-see;\\nThe people of Kathmandu are very friendly. In fact, Nepali people, in general, are always smiling and welcoming. Don’t be afraid to smile back.\\nKathmandu Top 5\\nDurbar Square\\nThe Monkey Temple\\nBudhanilkantha Temple\\nPashupatinath Temple\\nIndra Chowk Square\\nWhat to visit in Kathmandu\\nMost famous sites\\nDurbar Square\\nGarden of Dreams\\nIndra Chowk Square\\nMonkey Temple\\nFreak Street\\nBudhanilkantha Temple\\nNarayanhiti Palace Museum\\nThamel Neighborhood\\nPashupatinath Temple\\nHanuman Dhoka Palace\\nPatan\\nKeshar Library\\nSiddhartha Art Gallery\\nAsan Market\\nMap of Attractions\\nTours in Kathmandu\\nKathmandu City Guide\\nDurbar Square\\nDurbar Square\\nIf you have to choose only one thing to see in Kathmandu, Durbar Square, which is actually three squares in one, is probably the best option. The name means Square of Palaces and there are three of them at the Kathmandu Valley. The one at the Nepali capital can be considered its historic center. There you can see the temples built by the four kingdoms that shaped local History: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. Although there are older buildings in the area, most of them date back to the 17th and 18th centuries.\\nThe palace complex Hanuman Dhoka was built in this square, the seat of Nepal’s political power and the official residence of the king until the 19th century. The location had been chosen in the 3rd century by the Lichhavi Dynasty. The most important official ceremonies take place here, including the monarch’s coronation.\\nIt’s a place full of History but keep in mind that a lot of what you see there now are the result of reconstructions and restorations, essential to preserve the architectural heritage that has endured the devastating earthquakes that have continuously destroyed in Kathmandu.\\nGarden of Dreams\\nGarden of Dreams in Kathmandu, Nepal\\nThe locals call it Swapna Bagaicha and it’s a haven of tranquility in the middle of the busy city. The garden is not very big and it’s near the Thamel neighborhood, where most of the travelers stay.\\nIt was built in the 1920s by order of Field Marshall Kaiser Shamser, whose palace was in the area. He was inspired by the English gardens he had visited and designed a garden with 1.6 hectares and six pavilions. Only one-third of the original space and half of the pavilions made it to the present time.\\nOver time, the complex deteriorated, but it was restored at the beginning of the 21st century by the Austrians who designed the Patan Museum.\\nIt’s a place to be laidback, spend time wandering, and pay attention to the many charming details that make the Garden of Dreams.\\nIndra Chowk Square\\nIndra Chok in the historic section of Kathmandu\\nThis square is named after the deity Indra and it’s the perfect place for people watching and feel the pulse of Kathmandu’s daily life. Here you’ll see three temples, of Shiva, of Mahadev, where the vendors of blankets gather, and of Akash Bairab.\\nThe latter temple is also known as Sky Temple and it’s easily identifiable by the bronze lions that guard it. Keep in mind that only Hindus are allowed inside this temple.\\nTo the east of the square, sprawling over the many alleyways around it, you’ll find a peculiar and very colorful market called Raki Bazar. The name of the market originates in the belief that many of the merchants who work there now came from the area that’s now known as Iraq in the Middle Ages.\\nFreak Street\\nThe History of Freak Street mixes with Kathmandu’s of the 1960s and the 1970s, the city of the hippies, the utopia that became a nightmare for some of the people. This was the street where state-owned shops legally sold hashish and marijuana, and there were buses traveling from the airport and the border control posts of Nepal straight to Freak Street.\\nAll this nonstop party atmosphere ended when the USA pressured the Nepali government, which also launched a campaign to put an end to the hippies in Nepal. Part of them were deported to India as selling narcotics became illegal.\\nNowadays, nothing remains of those “different” years. Freak Street, officially called Jhhonchen Tole and that people now call “Old Freak Street,” is lined by cheap guesthouses, mountaineering agencies, restaurants, and souvenir shops. But tourists who travel to Kathmandu now prefer other parts of the city, especially Thamel.\\nIf you visit this area, look for the Eden Hotel. It played an important role in Freak Street’s history; it was the first drug store to open and the last to close. It was then known as Eden Hashish House.\\nThamel Neighborhood\\nMost hotels that cater to foreign tourists are located in this area, a neighborhood full of life and color, with many shops, and seen as Nepal’s business center.\\nIt replaced Freak Street at the end of the 1970s as the main hub for westerner travelers and ex-pats, stepping away from its historical roots. In the Middle Ages, there was a center of Buddhist education on the site.\\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, it wasn’t a reputable area, with high crime rates, but its good reputation has now been completely recovered. It’s an excellent base for travelers with shops selling trekking equipment, street food stalls, affordable accommodations, bookstores, laundries, and even a free WiFi network that covers the whole neighborhood.\\nHanuman Dhoka Palace\\nHanuman Dhoka Palace\\nIt was built during the Lichhavi period, that lasted from the 4th to the 8th centuries, but most of the structures were built in the 17th century when King Pratap Malla invested in growing it.\\nThe complex includes a museum with artifacts that belonged to different Nepali monarchs and sections that focus on other topics of National History, such as the abolishment of slavery.\\nUnfortunately, this palace was severely damaged in 2015 when an earthquake devastated the country. The reconstruction began immediately, but the original charm might have been lost forever.\\nPatan\\nPatan is about 5km south of Kathmandu, appropriately known as The City of Beauty. By the way, Patan is also known by another name, Yala. It’s the oldest city in Kathmandu Valley and was once an Independent State. It has an excellent group of temples, palaces, and different monuments.\\nIts Durbar Square is magnificent and you must also visit the Royal Palace, the temples Golden, Kumbeshwar, Rato Machhendranath, Mahabouddha, Minnath, Vishwanath, Bhimsen, and Krishna Mandir, the squares Sundari and Mul Chowk, the Buddhist monastery Uku Bahal, the Tibetan Temple, the statue of King Yoganarendra Malla, and the Patan Museum. And this list is far from complete considering how vast and rich the heritage in Patan is. There are more Hindu and Buddhist temples, small museums, ghats, historical squares, stupas, and even a zoo!\\nNot as charming as the sites mentioned above but historically interesting, Patan has an industrial area that dates back to the early 20th century and marks the beginning of mass production in the country. Don’t skip the Mangal Bazaar, the city’s cultural center.\\nKeshar Library\\nThis Keshar Library dates back to the early 20th century when Kaiser Shumsher visited England with his father. He was particularly impressed by the libraries he saw. When he returned to his country, he decided to create a library inspired by the British design, at the time only accessible to members of the royal family, Nepali academics, and foreigners. Only in 1968, when the library was donated to the Nation, were the books available to the public.\\nCurrently, the library has about 60,000 books, but the visitor can also see a series of pieces collected by Kaiser Shumsher and scattered around the place, in a sort of informal museum.\\nThe main reading room is particularly interesting, with an atmosphere that reminds us of a distant past of exploring an unknown world and of mysterious archaeological investigations.\\nUnfortunately, the library building was severely damaged by the earthquake in 2015 and three years later the rebuilding was still going on.\\nSiddhartha Art Gallery\\nThis art gallery is a refreshing alternative after a day visiting temples. It’s a little far from Kathmandu’s historic center, part of the Baber Mahal Revisited, a Neo-Classical shopping mall that was initially built in 1919 and is now one of the fanciest sites in the Nepali capital.\\nThe Siddhartha Art Gallery is the best place in the city dedicated to art, created in 1987 by Sangeeta Thapa and Shashikala Tiwari. Since then, over 300 exhibitions have taken place, especially with works by contemporary national artists, but including the works of some foreigners too.\\nThe gallery is focused on social topics, and that comes through not only in specific activities like supporting community-based art projects, but in the art collections they showcase, such as the Sequential Dissonance that showed a series of pieces depicting Kathmandu’s urban chaos.\\nAsan Market\\nThe Asan Market is at a square where six streets converge. The whole place is a vibrant commercial area where vendors maintain the centuries-old tradition of selling a little bit of everything from spices to traditional wedding accessories, vegetables, dried fish, and… yak tails.\\nThe market is open from dusk to dawn and in addition to visiting it, you can explore the surrounding neighborhood full of small temples, shrines, and tiny details.\\nFun fact: it’s said that Cat Stevens wrote his song “Kathmandu” while sitting at a tea house at the Asan Market.\\nNarayanhiti Palace Museum\\nThe Narayanhiti Palace was the headquarters of the Nepali monarchy and the current building was designed by architect Benjamin Polk and built in 1963.\\nThis was the site where, in 2001, the then King Birendra, his Queen, and his closest family members were massacred under conditions that have yet to be clarified. In 2008, after the establishment of a Republic in the country, the king was forced to leave the complex, which was turned into a museum.\\nThe interior provides travelers with a journey to Nepal’s recent past and the last days of the monarchy. You can see the throne, the banquet halls, and the royal family’s chambers.\\nThe museum is open every day except Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and an admission ticket for foreigners costs 500 Rs. Please note you can’t get in with a camera.\\nIn 2015, just like the rest of the city, the palace was affected by the earthquake that shook the capital of Nepal, but only the gates and the walls were damaged.\\nTemples in Kathmandu\\nMonkey Temple\\nMonkey Temple\\nAlso known as Swaymbhunath, the Monkey Temple is at the top of a hill, west of the city center. The location is perfect for fantastic views over the whole Kathmandu Valley.\\nThe complex of Swaymbhunath, which includes a stupa and several temples and shrines, is one of the oldest and most sacred religious sites in Nepal, with some of its elements dating back to the 3rd century. There you’ll also see a Tibetan monastery, a museum, a library, shops, restaurants, and even hostels.\\nThere are two ways to reach Swaymbhunath. If you’re walking, you can go up the long staircase up to the hill, almost in a straight line. If you’re driving, you have to follow the road around the hill to the top.\\nBudhanilkantha Temple\\nBudhanilkantha Temple\\nDespite the name, this is not a temple in honor of Buddha. In fact, Budhanilkantha means Old Blue Throat and it’s a place worshiped both by Buddhists and Hindus, and seen as a symbol of the religious harmony in Nepal.\\nThe main attraction in Budhanilkantha is the statue in the water tank. It represents God Vishnu and the statue is known as “sleeping Vishnu.” The sculpture was carved in one solid block of basalt stone, has a total of 5 meters in length, and depicts Vishnu laying on a bed made with the coils of serpent Shesha, the eternal queen of all snakes.\\nFun fact: a Nepali legend that supposedly dates back to the 17th century and is based on a vision King Pratap Malla had, claims that any monarch in Nepal who visits Budhanilkantha will die. Since then, not one Nepali King has stepped foot at the temple.\\nPashupatinath Temple\\nPashupatinath Temple\\nThis religious complex, the largest in Nepal and the oldest in Kathmandu, is in the outskirts of Kathmandu about 5 km northwest of the city, by the shore of the sacred Bagmati River.\\nThe temple is one of the eight sites listed as Kathmandu Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it’s the house of Nepal’s official deity, Pashupatinath.\\nIts history dates back to before the 5th century, when the first temple was built there in stone, by King Shupuspa of the Lichhavi Dynasty, to replace a former wooden building that had been consumed by termites.\\nThe main building has the distinctive style of the Nepali pagodas, with cubic units, a support structure made of carved wood, and copper roofs on both floors covered in gold. One of the top features is the golden pinnacle.\\nFortunately, the beautiful complex of Pashupatinath survived the devastation caused by the 2015 earthquake unharmed.\\nFestivals and National Holidays\\n11 January – Prithvi Jayanti\\n18 February – Martyrs’ Day\\n4 March – Maha Shivaratri\\n8 March – International Women’s Day\\n20 March – Fagu Purnima (Holi)\\n29 March – End of the school year\\n14 April – Nepali New Year\\n20 April – Buddha Jayanti (Birthday of Gautama Buddha)\\n1 May – International Labor Day\\n19 September – Sambidhaan Diwas (Day of the Constitution)\\n7 November – Laxmi Puja (worshiping of cows in the morning and Goddess Laxmi in the afternoon)\\n8 November – New Year on the Nepal Sambat calendar\\n9 November – Bhaitika\\n28 December – King’s Birthday\\nAccommodation\\nKhangsar Guest House\\nTerrace view of Khangsar Guest House\\nBedroom at Khangsar Guest House\\nKhangsar Guest House is a family-run hotel, in the center of Kathmandu in Chhetrapati next to Thamel, a tourist destination in Kathmandu and the most famous neighborhood in the city.\\nI stayed several times at this hotel in Kathmandu because I was in and out of the city many times in the month I traveled in Nepal.\\nThe location of this hotel in Kathmandu is strategic and convenient to get around, explore the city, and visit the old temples of Kathmandu.\\nThis guesthouse was established by Mr. Rajendra, a lovely man who helped me in many different ways.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nVISIT DUSHANBE\\nDushanbe is the capital city of Tajikistan, in the Hissar Valley, on the east side of the country. Its past isn’t glorious. In 1924, it went from a simple village to the capital city of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. It has several points of interest to keep a traveler busy for a few days.\\nYou can’t visit Tajikistan and not include Dushanbe in your itinerary otherwise you’ll be missing out on a must-see destination.\\nDushanbe’s origins are connected to the market that took place at a crossroads every Monday. The name of the city, Dushanbe, means Monday precisely. Although there are traces of a human settlement that dates back to the 5th century BC, the first historical reference dates back to 1676. There was a fortress in this location in 1875 and until the beginning of the 20th century, it wasn’t more than a small village.\\nThe Bolshevik Revolution changed that by making Dushanbe the capital city of Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic and changing its name to Stalinabad. As part of the Soviet Union, the region was transformed into a cotton and silk production center and tens of thousands of people were brought to the city to work in that industry. Nowadays, the city has 780,000 people and is a must-see destination in any visit to Tajikistan.\\nDushanbe the capital of Tajikistan\\nQuick travel tips to visit Dushanbe:\\nWake up early to be the first at monuments, museums, and other attractions;\\nAlthough it’s a very cliché thing to do, you must attend an opera show;\\nIn the evening, everyone goes walking at Rudaki Park. Follow their lead and visit at that time too;\\nLearn more about the local seasons and climate to know when to go to Dushanbe. The best time to visit Dushanbe is between April and October, which are the months with the best weather for tourism in Tajikistan;\\nDon’t miss the 1500-year-old, 13-meter long clay statue of a reclining Buddha at the National Museum of Antiquities;\\nThere is a lot to see in Dushanbe in Tajikistan, so make sure you plan your trip well. That way you’ll have time to see all the sites at your own pace and have a memorable vacation.\\nDushanbe Top 5\\nRudaki Park & Presidential Park\\nMuseum of National Antiquities\\nHissar Fort\\nDousti Square\\nRohat Teahouse\\nWhat to visit in Dushanbe\\nMost famous sites\\nMuseum of National Antiquities\\nHissar Fort\\nRudaki Park\\nPresidential Palace Park\\nGurminj Museum of Music\\nDousti Square\\nVictory Park\\nAyni Opera and Ballet Theater\\nDushanbe Markets\\nEthnography Museum\\nFlag Pole Park\\nNational Museum\\nNurek Lake\\nIndependence Monument\\nNoor Art Gallery\\nMevlana Yakub Charki Mosque\\nPalace of Nations\\nBoghi Poytakht Park\\nArtists’ Colony\\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church\\nMap of Attractions\\nDushanbe City Guide\\nHissar Fort\\nHissar Fort is 30 km west of Dushanbe. It was built in the 18th century and destroyed by the Russian army in 1924. From the original structure, only the recently renovated gate with two towers made it to the present time. Before the Soviet Union era, the fort was the residence of the “Bek,” a deputy of the Emir. The original walls were one-meter thick with lots of slots through which the defenders could fire against the attackers. What’s left of the original fort is part of a complex that includes a mosque, the Mahdumi Abzam mausoleum (16th century), an old inn (1808), a Registan (a wide square before the gate), and two madrasas, one built in the 16th century and one more recent. The older madrasa houses a History Museum.\\nDousti Square\\nThis square is the heart of Dushanbe and its name means “Friendship Square.” The place is frequently called as just Statue of Somoni, because of the massive sculpture at the center of the square. The statue honors Ismail Somoni, who ruled at the end of the 9th century and is seen as the father of the nation. It’s 13 meters tall and it’s under a 43-meter arch. At this square you’ll also see the Star of Independence, a monument created in 2011 to celebrate the 20 years of Tajikistan’s independence. The other highlight is the country’s gigantic flag, a rectangle 60×30 meters, rising at 165 meters, and weighing 420 kg. In the evening, the fountains performing a show of sound and light are the main attraction.\\nRudaki Park\\nFrom the Dousti Square visit the adjacent Rudaki Park and enjoy the beautiful lush green scenery.\\nVictory Park\\nYou’ll have beautiful views over Dushanbe from Victory Park. There used to be a cable car that took people to the top, built in the Soviet era, but it’s been inactive for years. I recommend the on-site café to enjoy the sunset with a drink. The Victory Park also has a Soviet monument in honor of the people who died during the Second World War or, as it’s known on former Soviet Union countries, the Great Patriotic War. It includes an eternal flame and the engraved names of the Tajiki soldiers who received the Hero of Soviet Union medal. The Park was officially inaugurated to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the end of the war but it already existed since 1975. The best way to reach the park is by taking a taxi in Dushanbe.\\nAyni Opera and Ballet Theater\\nThe Ayni Opera and Ballet Theater was built in the early 1940s in the middle of the Second World War. It’s at Rudaki Avenue, Dushanbe’s main street. Operas in Russian and Tajiki have been playing here since it opened. The beautiful building was renovated in 2009 and the gardens around it were restored in 2013. An evening at the opera is an excellent option for travelers in the city and the tickets are easy to buy at the ticket office. The prices are usually low, even more so on the frequent occasions when a big company or a foreign embassy is sponsoring the show. There is a dress code to attend the show.\\nDushanbe Markets\\nAs elsewhere in Central Asia, markets are a must-see. At the country’s capital city, there are some interesting markets including the Shah Mansur, also known as Green Bazaar, the largest of them all, in the city center, where you can buy all sorts of food products. The architecture of the main building alone is worth the visit. The Korvon Bazaar is further from the city and you need to travel there either by Mashrutkas or taxi. It’s a cheaper market with a large section for textiles. There are many more markets, of course, with a more local vibe, smaller, and more authentic.\\nNurek Lake\\nThis artificial lake was created when the second tallest dam in the world was built, 80 km southeast of the Tajik capital. The body of water stretches for 70 km and its gorgeous shade of blue is a beautiful backdrop for long walks on the lakeshore. It’s a popular area for country houses and you can see many floating houses on the shores of Nurek Lake. The area is crucial from a strategic viewpoint, which means you can only visit with a special permit for security reasons. That can be fixed by hiring the services of AquaClub, a kind of resort that offers all sorts of tour packs including boat trips from Dushanbe and several water sports.\\nMuseums in Dushanbe\\nMuseum of National Antiquities\\nThe Museum of National Antiquities is somewhat obsolete, but that only adds to its charm, turning it almost into a piece of its own collection. It began in 1934 when the local branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences inaugurated an exhibition with about 500 pieces. The collection grew over time with archaeological findings from excavations all over Central Asia. After the independence, in 1996, funds were spent in creating a standalone museum at a two-floor building in the city center. The exhibition is organized into historical periods, where the oldest pieces date back to 4000 BC. One of the must-sees is the massive 13-meter long Buddha, found in the 1960s at the excavations in Ajina-Tepe.\\nGurminj Museum of Music Instruments\\nThis museum was founded in 1990 by musician and actor Gurminj Zavkibekov. He passed away in 2003 and his son Iqbol Zavkibekov, who is also a musician, took over the museum. The museum includes about 100 music instruments, mostly string instruments, representing the Pamiri and the Badakhshani musical tradition. Unfortunately, there aren’t any informative labels. The museum also organizes events and recitals.\\nEthnography Museum\\nThis museum shares a building with the more famous Museum of National Antiquities. The Ethnography Museum is a lot smaller but has a gorgeous collection. The top pieces are the traditional clothes, some jewelry pieces, and the fabrics known as “atlas,” produced using a traditional method and dyed with natural pigments. Unfortunately, you’re not allowed to photograph inside the museum.\\nNational Museum\\nOne of the top features of the National Museum is precisely the building, modern, with an ellipse roof, and a grand foyer. The exhibition is organized into three sections: Natural History, Archaeology, and Fine Arts. One of the highlights is the replica of the Buddha found at the archaeological excavations in Ajina-Tepe. The age of the Soviet Union is represented by a mere collection of bank notes and the post-independence era, despite far more documented, is marked by just a collection of photographs. To photograph inside the museum, you have to pay an extra fee.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

This segment of the road is very beautiful because it mixes red color rocky mountains and sand. Erfoud is famous for its many marine fossil quarries because they contain fossilized colonies of invertebrate mollusks of incredible diversity.

From the army post of Tisserdmine, we would ride all the way to Erg Chebbi Dunes to a hotel called Auberge Café du Sud.\\nFrom Auberge Café du Sud, we would take the tracks back to Erfoud – profiting from the existing 8.5 miles / 14 km of asphalt.\\nSo far everything seems ok, right? What is then peculiar about this trip?\\nWell, the motorcycle was not really an authentic motorcycle… I mean, it is… but it is not. It has pedals… and it is called: “Moped”.\\nRide a Motorcycle in Morocco\\nA moped is a small, low-speed motorcycle, driven by an engine as well as bicycle pedals. In Morocco, these small bicycles are commonly called “Mobylette“.\\nSo, we rode Motobécane motorcycles across the Sahara Desert. The trip was amazing and we had the chance of crossing a beautiful part of the Moroccan desert on our own. These tracks are usually crossed by 4WD only.\\nAs I had lived in the region for almost 5 years, my knowledge of this part of the desert was quite good. The way from Erfoud to Erg Chebbi Dunes can be easily made following either the marked tracks through Merzane or the asphalt road through Rissani.\\nWe just wanted to explore further, so we turned left into the wild desert and started following whatever path, track or desert mark that inspired us. It took us around 9 hours to cross about 25 miles / 40 km on low speed, not desert prepared moped.\\nAround the same date in 2008, I made another trip from Erfoud to Erg Chebbi Dunes, but with a bicycle.

       " ['Lake Tana, Stone Castles and Holy Wars – Ethiopia\\nAll along the 16th and 17th centuries, the ancient region of Abyssinia was struggling to maintain its millennial-year old cultural values, protecting its religion and language against Islam. This was a time of ferocious Holy Wars.\\nOn the shores of Lake Tana – Ethiopia, there are still the remains of a small village, dating from the early 1600s, that totally changed the country’s architecture style. Throughout history, Ethiopia has always been a leading Christian territory.\\nIn 1487, D. João II – the Portuguese King, sent Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva to Ethiopia to investigate the location of that mythical kingdom, in an attempt to make it a possible ally on a subsequent expedition to India.\\nPêro da Covilhã stayed there and eventually integrated himself within the community, mixing with the locals. Documents are proving that, around the year 1543, there was a small Luso-Ethiopian community in the region. As a result of the aggressive invasions of the Ottoman Empire, Empress Mother Eleni sought to get help from Portugal and asked for assistance.\\nEthiopian Family in Gorgora Nova\\nBy this, the Portuguese were partly responsible for the independence of Ethiopia, with extensive fighting campaigns against the Muslims. Portuguese military campaigns made it possible to preserve Christianity in the oldest Christian country in the world – Ethiopia.\\nThe Portuguese army presence in the region supported the Ethiopians against Muslims, who had conquered neighboring Eritrea in 1557. Leaving behind the usual century-old campgrounds, the Ethiopian monarchs started to build castles, similar to the Portuguese ones: made of stone, with two or three floors, and of square design.\\nThe most notable examples of the influence of Indo-Portuguese architecture in Northern Ethiopia architecture are the castles and palaces of the medieval historical city of Gondar. These Gondar monuments include Fasilides’ Castle, the adjacent palaces, and Fasilides’ Bath.\\nVisit Gorgora Nova ruins in Ethiopia\\n17th century Portuguese Jesuit church of Nova Gorgora in Lake Tana, Ethiopia\\nRead my page: Historical Places to Visit in Ethiopia\\nGorgora Nova\\nRuins of Gorgora Nova Cathedral in Ethiopia\\n17th century Portuguese Jesuit settlement\\nGorgora Nova ruins\\nThe Jesuit missionaries settled about 7 miles / 11 km southwest of Gorgora town – at 5905 feet / 1800 meters high. They called this new outpost Gorgora Nova. Under the supervision of Pêro Pais, an impressive baroque style Catholic church, a Royal Palace, and some Jesuit residences were built within a small stone village.\\nGorgora Nova represents the beginning of stone construction around Lake Tana and in Ethiopia. The missionary Pêro Pais succeeded in converting the Emperor to Catholicism, but his son – Emperor Fasilides, quickly sent the Portuguese out – returning to Orthodox Christianity.\\nWhatever remains of the old Jesuit settlement was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake a few decades ago. There is a project, from the Ethiopian and the Portuguese Government, to rebuild and fix the whole complex with funds from UNESCO, but when, we do not know.\\nI’m positively sure that this will not last much longer. Will they come on time before this important part of history disappears?\\nIn the northern region of Gondar – Dembya district, there are other interesting historical sites: the Man Indeaba Monastery, the Stele of Mosoloni, the Monastery of Debresina Maryam, and the ruins of Emperor Susenyos’s palace.\\nHow to get there\\nVideo in how to get to Gorgora Nova\\nWith great effort, I decided to go there – to reach this supposedly hard destination. To get to Gorgora Nova, aka Mariame Gemb, was not easy, as there is no local direct transport. I took the bus from Gondar until a small village 11 miles / 17 km away from Gorgora.\\nAt that time, there was no longer local transport heading to Lake Tana, so I had to walk until reaching Gorgora just before sunset. The next morning I had to go on off-road driving, 7 miles / 11 km to the old Portuguese settlement, which is now protected by an armed guard.\\nWalk 17km to Gorgora in Lake Tana\\n11 km 4WD transportat along Lake Tana\\nStaying for two nights in Lake Tana was one of my best experiences in Ethiopia. A fantastic location with hippos, monkeys and many exotic birds. The sunrise was one of the nicest I’ve ever seen in my life. I slept at Tim & Kim Village, a very nice hotel in Gorgora.\\nAfter a long walk, I finally reached Gorgora Nova, where I was welcomed by the site’s guardian and his family. This Ethiopian family lives just aside from the old ruins and maintains the place safe and protected. The strategic position of the ruins makes us understand why this was built there. You can see the whole lakeshore. Breathtaking.\\nSunset in Lake Tana\\nFisherman in Lake Tana\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Located in the foothills of a huge rocky mountain called Jbel Adad (literally Mountain Finger), the landscape is made of volcanic rock, resembling some Lava Fields in Iceland.\\nJbel Adad is located right on the northern slopes of Jbel Saghro Mountain, which geographically corresponds to the connection between the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas.\\nWhat to do around Jbel Adad\\nJbel Adad and a herd of goats\\nJbel Adad is located in a severe desert environment. Still, some people and a small variety of wildlife survive. On this page I make a small description of the things to do around the pre-Islamic site of Jbel Adad, where we can find old tombs structures and petroglyphs.\\n1. Pre-Islamic tombs\\nPre-Islamic tombs near Ouarzazate\\nThere are several pre-Islamic tombs around Jbel Adad. All around the surrounding hills, huge standing stones limit small reliefs of large rocks and several oval structures, sunk into the ground. Several other concentrated stone structures could be tombs, but we can’t tell.\\nPre-Islamic tombs near Ouarzazate\\nThese are known to be pre-Islamic since Muslims bury their dead with the head pointing towards Mecca in Saudi Arabia. On the northern part of the mountain there are some small tombs, but further south, on the way to the petroglyphs, there are relatively high rock structures with about 1 m / 3.2 ft high.\\nPre-Islamic tombs near Ouarzazate\\nMany of these tombs are spread around a big area, so either you spend a few hours walking, or, you just drive from site to site.\\n2. Azib N’Oudad\\nUpper view of Azib N Oudad\\nTwo families live in the little oasis settlement of Azib N’Oudad. This place literally means “Sheepfold of the Fingers.” Indeed several sheepfolds can be found around this oasis.\\nSheepfold in Azib N Oudad\\nThere are a few houses and a water well with fresh drinkable water year-round – even in the hottest summers of 52º C / 125º F.\\nWoman getting water from well in Azib N Oudad\\nWhen I was there, I helped a lady carrying some buckets of water from the well to her house.\\n3. Petroglyphs\\nPetroglyphs near Ouarzazate\\nI have a personal obsession with rock art in general, no matter if it is pictographs, petroglyphs or earth figures such as geoglyphs or intaglios. Near one of the nomad camp of Jbel Adad, there is a fabulous example of petroglyphs.\\nPetroglyphs near Ouarzazate\\nAlthough we can also find other geographic patterns such as grid lines in the nearby hill, these, in particular, are amazing. I had to come to this place a second time since I didn’t find the petroglyphs on the first day.\\nPetroglyphs near Ouarzazate\\nRock art is usually divided into three types: petroglyphs, which are carved into the rock surface; pictographs, which are painted onto the surface; and earth figures, engraved into the ground.\\nPetroglyphs near Ouarzazate\\nThe location of these petroglyphs provides incredible views over the surrounding desert mountains. There is one of the engravings that beautifully portrays a camel eating / drinking water.\\n4. Drink tea with a nomad family\\nOuarzazate nomad camp\\nNomadic herders are thought to have existed in North Africa from around 4000 BC.\\nNomad family with donkeys coming back from oasis\\nToday, this way of life persists, and around Jbel Adad still live half a dozen Amazigh (Berber) nomad families. Daily life is rough due to the harsh mountain desert environment of southern Morocco. Daily tasks are strictly divided among the members of the family.\\nBread, Moroccan tea, warm butter with honey\\nWhile the men go to herd the goats in the mountain from early morning until sunset, the women take care of the kids, pick water at the nearby oasis and prepare the food.\\nServing Moroccan tea by friendly man\\n5. Rocky Canyon Oasis\\nRocky canyon oasis near Jbel Adad\\nJust a 20-minute walk into the rocky gorge we can find a beautiful greenish oasis. There are a water well and plenty of fig trees year round, and several nomad families get together every two days, to fill up their water containers and take water back to their camp.\\nSpring inside the rocky oasis\\nTemperature drastically changes from the moment you get under the shadow provided by the trees. There’s a nearby 10 m / 32 ft waterfall that dries up during the summer months.\\n6. Wildlife\\nGrasshopper looking at me..l think.\\nApart from camel and goat herds, you’ll probably notice some curious Rainbow-Agama lizards. If you’re lucky you can spot wolves, especially around dawn – a nomad told me.\\nInside the rocks, there are many rainbow agama lizards.\\nRainbow Agama Lizard\\nMorocco is a birdwatcher’s paradise. Even in desert areas, we can spot different bird species. Jbel Adad is also good for bird watching. I had three desert Dunn’s Lark birds following me while I was searching for the petroglyphs.\\nDunn’s Lark bird following me the whole time\\nAnd of course, the best “animal” experience you can have while visiting Jbel Adad, is to interact with the goats. The little ones will want to suck your finger.\\nGoat sucking my finger\\n7. Trekking\\nTrekking around Ouarzazate\\nYou can walk all the way to this mountain, coming from Ouarzazate. Take into consideration that you shouldn’t hike in the desert during summer months as temperatures are extreme. Two or three days are enough to walk 30 km / 19 mi from Ouarzazate, set your tent and explore the region for one or two days, and return.\\nYou can also drive, enter the tracks to reach the nomad camp, and from there explore the area during the day. Inevitably, nomads will invite you for a cup of tea, bread and melted butter with honey.\\nRemember that, if you’re a man, you shouldn’t try to interact with a nomad woman on her own. If you want to be invited for a cup of tea, you’ll have to wait until her husband or brother arrives. If you’re a woman, indeed you are free to interact with the woman and the little nomad girls.\\n8.

How to understand it\\nDjemaa El Fna\\nWell, indeed Marrakesh is a bustling commercial city, but we have to realize that Marrakesh has been welcoming foreigners for centuries. It’s not just the casual hippy trail city, nor did it start to receive travelers since the 1970’s. We are talking about 700 years of history concerning foreigners: either tourists, students, pilgrims, businessmen, traders.\\nGnawa musician in Djemaa El-Fna\\nBut where have all these people come from?\\nThe city became the capital of the Almoravid Emirate, which stretched from the shores of Senegal to the center of Spain and Portugal and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers.\\nMarrakesh prestigious Koranic schools received Muslim students from all around North and West Africa, Andalous, the Middle East and Central Asia.\\nThe Zaouias of the 7 Saint of Marrakesh receive Moroccan pilgrims all the year round.\\nCommercial hub that receives businessmen and traders for ages.\\nFor centuries, the old city souks received businessmen and traders. The famous Djemaa el Fna (Jemaa El Fna) square was always filled with street performers, musicians, acrobats, snake charmers, monkey traders, storytellers, dentists, henna tattoo artists, restaurant stalls, tea carriages, medicine men, you name it!\\nSnake Charmer in Marrakesh\\nBeing the capital of Morocco during the 12th and 13th centuries, Marrakesh was, for a long time, a major political, economic and cultural center of the western Muslim world.\\nIn the past, Morocco was known in the East under the name of Marrakesh.\\nMorocco, the name itself comes from the Portuguese mispronunciation of Marrakesh, as in “Marrocos.”\\nPlace Djemaa El Fna is included in the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\\nPlace Djemaa El Fna UNESCO sign\\nJuan Goytisolo, a Spanish novelist, and poet, gave a speech during the event of the first day of inclusion of Marrakesh as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Here is an excerpt of his speech, which reveals the authenticity of this eye-popping square:\\n“The spectacle of Djemaa El-Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes — voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches. The oral tradition is framed by one much broader — that we can call intangible. The Square, as a physical space, shelters a rich oral and intangible tradition.“\\nThe reason for this is that Djemaa El-Fna is indeed different from every other place you will ever visit. It is a legitimate open-air theater, an outdoor circus, an open-air concert hall, an open-air scene of… insanity…\\nDjemaa El-Fna Video\\nOn this video, you will meet the real Djemaa El-Fna square, its sounds, and unique street performers.\\nWho will you find in Djemaa El-Fna\\nI will promptly make a list of several people you will encounter on Marrakesh main square.\\n1.

Horse “Calèches”\\nHorse-drawn carriage of Marrakesh\\nDjemaa El-Fna Stories\\nWhat is this man doing with your money?\\nWater seller in Marrakesh\\nThe other day, I learned a lesson.\\nIn Djemaa El-Fna you can find the popular photogenic water sellers. They do sell water as many Moroccans do support them, but they are one of the city’s major tourist attractions. If you want a picture, you have to pay.\\nHow much?\\nWell, it all depends on you, but from 5 DH up to 20 DH is OK.\\nThe other day, early in the morning, I was walking down from my hotel when I saw one of the water sellers carrying a bucket and a heavy plastic bag. He started feeding the stray cats near Koutoubia mosque.\\nI followed him to the Koutoubia garden, where literally dozens of stray dogs came to be fed, by this poor man.\\nWater seller in Marrakesh\\nI talked to him, and he told me:\\n“I am a simple person, I don’t have a family, so the money I earn working in Djemaa El-Fna is mostly spent buying meat to feed these poor animals. They are also made by God.“\\nWater seller in Marrakesh\\nSo, every single morning of his life, this person so often criticized for asking money for pictures, dedicates himself to the hopeless stray animals of Marrakesh.\\nHow about that?\\nMoney vs Photo – the hard truth to know\\nGive money in Marrakesh\\nOn the other day, while speaking to a friend that came to visit me here in Morocco, he was happily telling me about his amazing trip to Australia. While talking about Sydney, he highlighted the lively ambiance, relaxed people, and many street performers.\\nI asked him: “Did you give them some money?“\\nHe said: “Oh yeah, this man playing with fire I even gave him 5 dollars!“.\\nSO, this is the guy who first told me that he hated Marrakesh and all those people asking him for money in Djemaa El-Fna.\\nFor my friend, they are nothing more than hustlers whereas, in fact, they are nothing more than street performers.\\nSo, what is the difference between visiting London, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and supporting artists, and giving some coins to the guys in Djemaa El-Fna? Is it worth getting angry?\\nWell, I let this question out in the open for you to think about.\\nJemaa el Fna Q&A – Questions and Answers\\nJemaa el Fna upper view\\nIs the square safe by night?\\nYes, apart from pickpockets, the square is very safe.\\nIs there any police?\\nYes, apart from the dozen undercover policemen, the main police station of Marrakesh Medina is also located in Djemaa El-Fna. Several police vans are also parked near the Bank al-Maghreb.\\nAre there pickpockets?\\nYes, apart from the dozen undercover policemen, the main police station of Marrakesh Medina is also located in Djemaa El-Fna. Several police vans are also parked near the Bank al-Maghreb.\\nAre those real snakes?\\nYes, those are real snakes. Most snakes are either with broken teeth, or their venom is taken out. But I know that every couple of years, some snake charmers die due to their profession.\\nIs it OK to make a picture with a snake?\\nYes, it’s ok. It’s safe. But, you’re using a scared and “circus” animal for your profit. Supporting animal abuse should be avoided anywhere in the world.\\nHow much should I give to the snake charmers?\\nMake your picture and give them 5 to 10 DH. If they ask 100 DH, just say no. If you give 20 DH, expect to be invited to a tea, or seat near them and make all the pictures you want. Give them 50 DH, and you’ll be the king.\\nWill the monkey guy hit me if I don’t give him money?\\nNo, not at all. Just say no, and go away, or, say yes, make your picture and give him 5 to 10 DH. If he asks 100 DH, just say no.\\nSome people do look strange and crazy. Are they OK?\\nNo, they are not OK. Some people in Marrakesh and in Djemaa El-Fna are alcoholics or mentally very unstable. But the majority of individuals are quite reasonable and sane, don’t worry – but leave the crazy ones alone.\\nIs it safe to make a henna tattoo?\\nIt depends. Regular brown henna is OK, but never make a tattoo with black henna. It’s made of a mix of chemical substance that can be very harmful and burn your skin.\\nWhat should I do to get a seat near the musicians?\\nMusicians are there to get money but, above all, to have fun. If you get to the group, they will ask you for some change. Give up some 5 or 10 DH, and ask to be seated. You’ll be close to the musicians and other Moroccans who are there just to have fun. Once in a while, throw 2 DH to the floor when the chief performer asks people for money. They usually only start playing when they make a certain amount of money. Usually 20 DH.\\nShould I pay the musicians or leave?\\nIf you want to have a splendid time, pay 2 or 5 DH and stay listening to some good music. If you go there and decide not to pay, you’ll eventually go away and miss a great show. If you don’t have any coins, just look the guy in the eye and tell him the truth.\\nAre those women belly dancing actually hitting on me?\\nNo, they are not women. Yes, they are hitting on you. They will kiss you!\\nWhere can I go to observe Djemaa El-Fna, comfortably and without any hassle?\\nYou can go up the terrace of Le Grand Balcon du Café Glacier, which has undoubtedly the best view over the square. For the second best view go on the terrace of Café de France. You have to consume either Coca-Cola, a bottle of water, mint tea or orange juice to get in. Entrance drink costs 15 DH. You can seat as long as you like. If there’s no table just wait until someone eventually goes away.\\nHow much should I give to the Gnawa musicians?\\nThese young guys can be as friendly as rude. Be nice to them from the beginning, and you’ll make great photos and videos. For a one-to-one show, give from 10 to 20 DH. Maybe if they are two, give 10 DH each and say you can’t really give more. Smile and try to make a conversation and they will soon forget about the commercial side of their daily life. If they ask 100 DH, just say no.\\nCan I drink the water sold by the water seller?\\nBasically, it’s treated city tap water. Some people can deal with it, and other people cannot. I advise you not to drink this water since the cups are used by dozens of individuals daily. Plus, the water is contained inside the animal skin, so watch out some nasty bacteria.\\nHow much should I give the water seller for a picture?\\nMake your photos and give him 5 to 10 DH. If they ask 100 DH, just say no.\\nIs it safe to eat in Djemaa El-Fna restaurants?\\nYes. Most restaurants are OK. Try number 1 – Aicha. A great variety of tasty food.\\nWhen do the restaurant stalls open?\\nThey open around 5 pm and close around 12 am.\\nCan I make photos of people?\\nYes, you can make photos of people, but you should definitely ask for permission first. Djemaa El-Fna performers are expecting tip over photos. So have some change ready.\\nI lost my wallet, what should I do?\\nWell, forget about it. But you can always go to the tourist police office to fill in a report. You should be very careful with your wallet and documents. Keep them tight and close to you. Never keep them in the back pocket of your jeans.\\nWhat are those shell type of animals people are eating?\\nThey are common snails cooked with local spices. Each stand has its own secret recipe.\\nDoes Djemaa El-Fna sleep?\\nYes, most activities only start in the afternoon. Musicians are there a bit before sunset until late at night.\\nI am a woman, do people come close to me?\\nSometimes, while you watch the shows in Djemaa El-Fna, you will possibly attract men that approach you just to be close. They might try to touch you. This is why you should always keep safe and fight back. If you notice, Moroccan women are either sat down near the musicians or in the company of a male. This is not something that will happen, but just keep this in mind. Ah – very important: dress appropriately and do not show your skin. This will keep male eyes away from you.\\nHow should I prepare myself before going to the square?\\nUse your wallet and documents on a hard to get part of your body. Don’t wear your backpack with valuable things on your back. Take coins with you. Don’t keep the coins near the rest of your money. Just keep them separately and take out one by one.\\nHow can I take the most out of Djemaa El-Fna?\\nIf you want to have the best time of your life, go to the bank and exchange 100 DH into 5 DH coins. Take your time, and enjoy all the shows. Talk to people, ask them to perform for you, give some coins back, interact, sit down, clap and sing… and… welcome to Djemaa El-Fna, the heart of Marrakesh.\\nDo they add sugar to the orange juice?\\nDuring the oranges season, they don’t mix the juice with water. But when they do so, maybe they add some sugar to the mix. That is why you should always ask for pure. Moroccan oranges are really sweet, and sometimes they do taste like they are sugar added. But they are not.\\nWhat should I not do while in Marrakesh?\\nYou should not try to make pictures of people without paying. They can turn aggressive. If you want to make pictures, talk to the guy first, give him some coins, and he will relax while you have time to make all the photos you wish.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Other smaller size monoliths can be seen nearby.\\nTo get to Ben Amera, there is no road. You have to get a 4WD and drive from Nouadhibou to Choum, on a two-day desert adventure.\\nMap with the location of Ben Amera monolith in Mauritania\\nA natural monolith is a large block of stone, consisting of a single element – most times being confused with a mountain. There are only 2 bigger monoliths in the world after Ben Amera, the monolith Uluru and Mount Augustus, both located in Australia.\\nOn the way to Ben Amera\\nCamels in Mauritania\\nBen Amera is surrounded by dunes, and the contrast effect on the landscape is breathtaking.\\nThroughout time, these huge rocks became very useful to sub-Saharan African traders, crossing the desert with camel caravans from Djenee in Mali, all the way to Morocco. When local people set fires, the light reflected on the rock, guiding travelers in the right direction amidst the dark Sahara Desert nights.\\n5 km / 3.1 mi away from Ben Amera lies another monolith.

It seems folk stories report that the destiny of those two rocks is the same as of humans.\\nBen Amera Monolith\\nClimbing Ben Amera monolith in Sahara Desert\\nLand mines sign in the desert\\nLegend says that, at the beginning of times, Ben Amara – the monolith, was married to one of his relatives, Aicha. These two monoliths were once a single block of stone.\\nWhen returning from a trip, Ben Amera surprised Ben Aicha in the arms of her lover. Enraged, he kicked her away – keeping their siblings close to him. So, today, you’ll see two small stone blocks alongside the imposing Ben Amera monolith. Ben Aicha is left alone with her maid, condemned to observe from afar her angry ex-husband.\\nI got to Ben Amera coming from Nouadhibou on the Atlantic Coast. It took me almost two days to get there, driving in the desert along the railway through the unstable region of the borderline between Morocco and Mauritania.\\nDuring two days we just came across one village called Tmeimichat; all the rest was desert, sand dunes, camel herds and minefields all along the northern part of the railway.\\nDriving to Tmeimichat\\nSunset near Tmeimichat\\nGetting ready to sleep near Tmeimichat\\nContinuing East after Ben Aicha, we drove to Choum and Atar at 103 km / 64 mi distance.

While in Noudhibou we packed our Land Cruiser Defender with supplies such as food, water, gas, extra engine battery, and other necessary goods.\\nWe got one day with a sandstorm, and some parts of the way were quite difficult due to extreme desert sand driving.

I spent the morning exploring some areas of the city where I had not been yet: the amusement park Dream City and the nearby supermarket, where I bought a compass.\\nDream City theme park in Dohuk – Hitchhiking Iraqi Kurdistan\\nIn Islam, all Fridays are used to worship God, pray and share a meal in community with other practitioners of the faith.\\nI returned to the hotel, where I had another chat about the Yazidi religion with the owner, who suggested I should go to Lalish to see the temple of his religion.\\nThe Yazidi religion dates back to around 2.000 BC and has about eight hundred thousand followers in the whole world. It used to be one of the established religions among the Kurds until obligatory Islamization reduced its number.\\nAccording to Yazidi beliefs, God created the world and left it guarded by seven Holy Beings, the angels of the Seven Mysteries.\\nIblis is a renegade Jinn, who refused God’s order of submitting himself to Adam and was sent to hell. Melek Ta’us, the first of the seven Yazidi angels created by God, was congratulated for having the conscience of his superiority when he refused to submit to Adam and was sent to Earth as His chief representative.\\nIn the course of time, many attempts were made all over the Middle East to exterminate the Yazidi devotees, and today, although the law allows them to exercise their faith, there is a general mistrust among the majority of Muslims, as they adore who Islam most despises.\\nTherefore, I had to try and go to Lalish to visit the place of worship of this so polemic religion, and I was informed that Friday and Saturday are the most crowded days in that precinct.\\nI had the chance to see many people and reasonably understand how Melek Ta’us devotion is practiced. All Yazidis have to make the Pilgrimage to Lalish at least once in their life.\\nTaking a taxi to Lalish would cost me 30.000 Dinar one-way, so I caught a cab until the exit of the city and tried to hitch a hike.\\nHitchhiking in Iraq\\nThe first car that stopped took me to the city police checkpoint and the policeman asked me what I was doing there.

He insisted on getting me a ride.\\nAnother car stopped and the driver, who spoke quite good English, said he would take me to the intersection of Sheikhan, some kilometers before Lalish.\\nChatting with this gentleman called Bayar, he told me that he was going to Aqrah (Akre), about 130 kilometers away, where he would stay for three hours and then return to Dohuk. Those words were a direct ticket to get to know Aqrah, a fabulous city with impressive views, waterfalls, and water springs.\\nView of Aqrah, Hitchhiking Iraqi Kurdistan\\nI was so lucky that he gave me a ride to and from Aqrah, took me to visit some waterfalls, paid my lunch and was extremely friendly.\\nBayar worked for a company that commercializes fertilizers and pesticides, and he was on his way to Aqrah to meet a local farmer.\\nWaterfalls in Aqrah, Hitchhiking in Iraqi Kurdistan\\nI did not go to Lalish, but I walked for three hours exploring Aqrah where I met two youngsters who guided me to the best places, introduced me to their friends, took me to the springs and waterfalls and paid for tea and ice-cream. Even before getting acquainted with those two boys, I was invited to have tea in an ironing shop where an approximately twenty-year-old juvenile was watching television on his own.\\nFriends I made in Aqrah\\nMaking friends while Hitchhiking in Iraqi Kurdistan\\nMaking friends in Iraqi Kurdistan\\nMaking friends while Hitchhiking Iraqi Kurdistan\\nIsmail and Ivan tried to explain to me that the city had a lot of Jews and that there was a famous Israeli military officer who was born there (the former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, as I later found out).\\nBack in Dohuk I was on the internet, strolled around the city and at nightfall went to Gely area of the valley where everybody meets to see and be seen. It is a place with a lot of water, fountains, and cafés. Much motion. I returned to the hotel, ate a piece of fruit that I had bought in the market and went to sleep.\\nView of Dohuk by night\\nNOTE: I’ve been to Iraq three times. The first time back in 2010, the second time at the beginning of 2016, and the third time just recently in 2018 traveling for one month driving my campervan.

       " ['9000-year-old rock paintings in Somaliland\\nI entered Somaliland on foot, coming from Ethiopia through the Wajaale border. After exploring the capital Hargeisa, I went further north to the coastal town of Berbera. After staying a couple of days on the beach, I finally got the plane back to Ethiopia.\\nSomaliland is a self-proclaimed country that technically, and according to the United Nations, is located in the most northwestern region of Somalia.\\nAlthough it’s not internationally recognized by the UN, it has protected and delimited land borders, its own military, its own president, its own currency, its own police. And it also proudly holds democratic elections since 1991. People of Somaliland are very friendly, and I felt very safe during my stay.\\nI have a particular obsession with rock art in general, no matter if it is pictographs, petroglyphs or earth figures such as geoglyphs or intaglios. On my way from Hargeisa to Berbera, I made a small effort to visit the wonderful Laas Geel rock paintings archaeological site.\\nLaas Geel Rock Paintings in Somaliland\\nGuided visit to Laas Geel\\nLocated 50 km / 31 mi from Hargeisa, in the middle of the desert and surrounded by rocky mountains, Laas Geel (also written Las Geel or Laas Gaal) is a set of several rocks and caves where rock art paintings are extremely well preserved. The humans and animals, portrayed with different colors inside, were made 9000 years ago! It’s a fascinating place in this region of the Horn of Africa.\\nFor me, it was rather surprising that on this trip to Somaliland I would visit and witness one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been in my life. Yes… in Somaliland – Somalia.\\nThe view from Laas Geel\\nLas Geel rock painting\\nImagine a set of 9000-year-old paintings depicting men and women, dogs, many cows, giraffes, all drawn on the rock surface, practically outdoors, but in excellent condition!\\nTo get to Laas Geel, you have to get a permit that costs 22 euros / 25 dollars. You also need a taxi with a private military armed escort to protect you. This escort costs 17.3 euros / 20 dollars, the taxi from Hargeisa from 60.5 euros / 70 dollars to 108 euros / 125 dollars.\\nA visit to Laas Geel can only happen if you are followed by a mandatory guide, a man who takes us through the mountains. He does not speak English, except the words “man,” “cow,” “dog.” You can give him some money in the end. Several sites are hiding these paintings, all being separated by about seven hills and caves to visit, but we have to do a little bit of trekking to get there.\\nEntrance to Laas Geel\\n9000-year-old rock art\\nThere is no doubt in my mind that, if this rock painting site was located in an internationally recognized country, it would be on the World Heritage List by UNESCO.\\nAt the entrance of the complex, there is a small house with a few panels explaining the history and cultural significance of Laas Geel.\\nLaas Geel history\\nAt the end of the visit, you can sign the guestbook. I was the third Portuguese to sign it. Another interesting fact is that this site was only found in 2003. Thus, a very recent discovery. If you are in this region, do not miss the opportunity to visit this unique place.\\nBesides Laas Geel, near Dhubato, Somaliland has some other fabulous locations with ancient villages, rock art, and megalithic sites: Dhagax Khouré, near Hargeysa; a few other examples in Massif Daimoleh and in the Mountains Goolits; Iskudar; Raari; Guideys; Cagarey; and Go’o.\\nTaxi from Hargeisa to Berbera via Laas Geel\\nTaxi Hargeisa to Berbera via Laas Geel in Somaliland\\nI took a private taxi from Berbera to Hargeisa, passing through Laas Geel rock paintings. The taxi picked me up at the Oriental Hotel front door in Hargeisa and left me at the door of Man-soor Hotel in Berbera. The road is made of tarmac except for the 14km / 8.7mi off-road track near Laas Geel. Along the way, we stopped to eat at a roadside restaurant. We were served spaghetti with vegetables, meat or fried fish.\\nThis whole area to Berbera is arid. Through the rocky mountains, you see lots of camels and small, poor villages. In Laas Geel, the driver and military go to sleep, and you are taken to visit the paintings accompanied by a mandatory local guide.\\nVisiting Laas Geel\\nSomaliland government entrance permit to Laas Geel\\nBring two bottles of water and some bananas for the trip. Leaving at 9 am from Hargeisa, it is expected that arrival at Berbera should be at around 4 or 5 pm.\\nAt the reception of the Oriental Hotel in Hargeisa, they sell tours and can hire you a taxi with an English speaking guide and armed escort. They also get you the Somaliland government entrance permit to Laas Geel. If you don’t have time to do things for yourself, or you just don’t want to bother, then you can make this trip for 170 euros / 195 dollars. They organize and prepare everything for you. You just have to be ready the next morning. This was what I did. Easier.\\nIf you want to do everything on your own, then the price of this service is usually 43 euros / 50 dollars for the taxi, driver, and fuel. 17 euros / 20 dollars for compulsory army escort. 22 euros / 25 dollars for Laas Geel entrance permit, which you have to get at an office somewhere in the city.\\nRead my page: Somaliland Travel Guide\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Visit Half Moon Island – forsaken humid Antarctica\\nIt was dark and foggy in Antarctica. My descent towards the south end of Half Moon Island was disagreeably damp, musty and cold, but yet it captivated me from the first moment.\\nAt first glance, I noticed the wreck of an old Norwegian wooden whaling boat, thousands of penguins and a few dozen Antarctic fur seals on the shore.\\nIf I could describe this place in a few words, I would say that Half Moon is an Antarctic island below of 60° South, covered by ice and populated by thousands of penguins. The sinister dark rocky mountains gave me an apocalyptic sight of this extremely remote destination.\\nHalf Moon Island – in the South Shetland Islands, has various types of rare plants and an important colony of Chinstrap penguins, Gentoo penguins and many Antarctic fur seals can also be seen.\\nWreck of a wooden boat, penguins and Antarctic fur seals\\nBeach view in Half Moon Island\\nGentoo penguins are long-tailed, with a bright orange bill and a white stripe on the top of the head. Chinstraps penguins are short-tailed, with the inner sides of their flippers colored in white. Their most distinct characteristic is the narrow black stripe under their heads.\\nIce slope with penguins\\nChinstrap Penguins\\nChinstrap Penguin colony\\nAntarctic Fur Seals on the beach\\nTo visit Half Moon Island is relatively easy, and I did a 5 km / 3 miles trekking from one side of the island to the other. I distinctly remember the loud penguin colony and the vivacious fur seals. Penguins are extremely curious, and many come in your direction to get a better glimpse. Half-moon Island has to be your list of what to do in Antarctica.\\nGentoo Penguins and Fur Seals in Half Moon Island\\nApart from the impressive vistas and 3000 pairs of penguins, there’s not much to see on the island, but it’s totally worth visiting to enjoy this sinister forsaken place in Antarctica.\\nChinstrap Penguin\\nDark rock\\nRocks\\nI traveled along the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands for 15 days, leaving the Argentine city of Ushuaia across the Drake Passage, down to 68° South in Stonington Island, beyond the Antarctic Circle.\\nA trip to Antarctica can be made on board a cruise ship usually departing from Tierra del Fuego in Argentina. In the southernmost city in the world – Ushuaia – you can embark on a once in a lifetime expedition.\\nImpressive view of Half Moon Island\\nFoggy view of Half Moon Island\\nNature made circle on a rock\\nThe best time to visit Antarctica is during the Antarctic summer months, i.e., during the months of December, January, and February. Before or after these dates it is a little out of season to have good weather and see many animals.\\nI stayed about two weeks in Ushuaia until I finally got a good deal on a last-minute Antarctica Cruise Ship deal. It was worth the waiting and the time spent visiting the tour company’s offices around the city.\\n15 days Antarctica Cruise Expedition from Ushuaia\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

This unusual place in the desert had plenty of water, so it used to be very productive and prosperous.\\nBirds in the marshes of Mesopotamia\\nThroughout history, it has always been well respected, because, among the arid climate of southern Iraq, the Mesopotamian Marshes allowed human beings and livestock to have a high quality of life.\\nFather and son from the Marsh Arab tribes of Iraq\\nIn 1950 during a massive oil exploration project, the drainage of the wetlands started. This process was taken to an extreme during the mandate of Saddam Hussein. This lead to the expulsion of local tribes, creating political and social tension in the southern parts of the country.\\nIslet in the marshes of Mesopotamia\\nCurrently, the Mesopotamian Marshes slightly recovered. Unfortunately, the last decade severe drought and the previously built infrastructure have left irreversible results in this territory.\\nRead the pages: Will Iraq’s wetlands join World Heritage List? and Iraqi marsh residents hold tight to their reed homes.\\nBoats of Iraq’s marshes\\nThe people who live in Iraq’s southern marshes are known as Ma’dān – or simple as – Arabs of the Marshlands. These people build incredible floating houses made of reeds harvested in their own marshes, transported in canoes and small boats.\\nTraditional house of Iraq’s Mesopotamian Marshes\\nThe reed houses are called “mudhif” and are built without any type of nails or wood. These rustic looking huts have the same style of construction of those in Lake Titicaca in Peru.\\nInside a reed house in southern Iraq\\nThe wetlands harvested reeds\\nDue to political problems of these tribes with Saddam Hussein and consequently almost complete draining of the marshes, this architectural style almost disappeared. There are some poor looking houses while other larger ones are more ornamented. Usually, each family has a main house and a separate lounge for receiving guests.\\nReed made house of the Mesopotamian Marshes\\nSaddam Hussein ordered to drain the marshes in 1991 as a punishment for those tribes who had supported the US incursion of Iraq. Consequently, there was a mass exodus of these people to other regions of the country.\\nMesopotamian Arabe\\nDespite all these problems, about 2000 inhabitants of the marshes still live in traditional houses. The number of residents was approximately a million and a half back in the 1950’s.\\nIraqi boy with a shotgun\\nAfter the overthrown of Saddam, local tribesmen recovery efforts finally began to show results, and the marshes water levels went up considerably. It was the rebirth of the great Mesopotamian Marshes.\\nIraqi Marshes area\\nThe wildlife and the natural ecosystem of the marshes will take some more decades to recover, while its people still didn’t give up their territory and their old way of life.\\nMan serving coffee inside his home\\nI had the unique opportunity of traveling to this part of Iraq. I was invited to visit several houses in the middle of the swamps. I was given food, tea, and coffee by friendly marsh Arabs who felt honored to receive me.\\nIraqi tea\\nNOTE: I’ve been to Iraq three times. The first time back in 2010, the second time at the beginning of 2016, and the third time just recently in 2018 traveling for one month driving my campervan.

The main goal to write this travel blog is to make other people inspired to discover new things and live great experiences.\\nLife is made of moments and the World is out there full of precious and unique adventures waiting for us. If traveling has given me such amazing travel experiences, why shouldn’t I share some travel advice with YOU?\\nNomad Revelations is an Adventure Travel Blog\\nSince 1999 I’ve traveled all over the world extensively. So far I have lived in countries such as Finland, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States of America and more recently Brazil – in Rio de Janeiro and Poland. I have around 120 months of traveling on a 20-year time.\\nMy top 3 favorite countries\\nMorocco\\nTurkey\\nTajikistan\\nFull list of my favorite countries: Afghanistan, Brazil, Ethiopia, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Mali, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Turkey, Oman, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Syria, Switzerland, Sudan, Tajikistan (Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region), Turkey, Uzbekistan.\\nRiver Panj along the border of Afghanistan and Tajikistan\\nWhy do I travel?\\nWhy not? I travel to be abroad, to see new stuff and learn a bit more about how people live in different parts of the globe. I like to communicate with people, know their ideas and get inspired by moments, sunrises and sunsets, talks, gastronomy, history, music, dance or Nature.\\nYou’d be even more astonished if you had seen them as I saw: parades with thousands of extras, crowds in belligerent movements, herds of elephants led by soldiers (as if those creatures were battle horses), shipwrecks where plenty of treasures were lost, crossings of swamps and forests with many wild beasts, fights at high sea in which all (or almost all) perished, besieged cities and soon totally destroyed by fire, beautiful princesses in their stunning palaces and disabled beggars, passions & follies.\\nWritten in 1580 by explorer and writer Fernão Mendes Pinto.\\nWhy the name Nomad Revelations?\\nI’m always on the move. I like to move from place to place and experiment with new cultures.\\n• nomad\\na. A member of a people or tribe who move from place to place to find pasture and food;\\nb. A person who continually moves from place to place; a wanderer.\\nDuring my years of traveling, I gathered so much information that I thought I might as well share it with other people.\\n• revelation\\na. The act of revealing or disclosing;\\nb. Something revealed, especially a dramatic disclosure of something not previously known or realized.\\nMaking friends with a local Uzbek mullah\\nA bit more about myself\\nI have a major in Visual Arts where I expanded my astuteness in painting, sculpture, photography, philosophy, and aesthetics. I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1980 and from an early age, I have been creatively stimulated to explore various means of self-development.\\nMy awareness of traveling was brought to me at university when sociology and anthropology of art definitely caught my attention, as in:\\n(Sociology) the study of the development, organization, functioning, and classification of human societies.\\n(Anthropology of Art) sub-field in social anthropology dedicated to the study of art in different cultural contexts.\\nFor me, the world made sense… so I just had to go ahead and start traveling. And that’s what I did… Along with my backpack, I started wandering around the world.\\nUntil now I visited over 130 UN countries and other internationally non-recognized territories such as Somaliland, Nagorno-Karabakh or even Transnistria. I traveled to Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Oceania.\\nAbout my difficult name: My name is João… like in J – O – A – O – Basically my name in other languages can be translated into John, Giovanni, Hans, Hovhannes, يحيى, Ian, Ioan, Ivan, Iven, Ifan, Jack, Jackson, Jan, Jane, Janez, Jean, Jhon, Joan, Johan, Johanan Johannes, Jovan, Juan, Juhani, Seán, Siôn.\\nLiving in Morocco\\nI live in south Morocco since 2006. I work with my sister that joined me here in Ouarzazate in 2009. In 2010, we opened Dar Rita, a hotel in Ouarzazate. We also have RJ Travel Agency, a Tour Operator that organizes adventure Holidays in Iran, Syria, Bosnia, Morocco, Lebanon, and Uzbekistan. Additionally, in 2019 we opened Dar Digital Nomad, among one of the few coliving and coworking space in Morocco.\\nADVENTURE TRAVEL BLOG\\nA life on the road\\nYes, while in search of destinations one may find those places that do not actually exist. I’ve traveled to the de-facto country of Transnistria (Pridnestrovia) and spent a few days in Tiraspol. This seems to be the perfect destination for an Adventure Travel Blog right?\\nFilling anonymous voids with experiences while committing them to memory, these places then take on another life. Now, I can say they definitely do exist.\\nThen, there are the other nonexistent places between destinations, the interstitial and transitory “places”. Lived during moments when we may be recollecting where we just were while foreshadowing what is soon to arrive, these unnamed territories can also be the most memorable. I’ve experienced three one-month train journeys across Europe.\\nOn the road, I’ve passed 15 days driving in Iceland along the Ring Road and Westfjords, then driving solo through Afghanistan followed by a 14,000 km. (8,700 mi.) road trip through South America, across Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay.\\nNext, I took a 4,383 km Russia road trip (2,723 mi.), driving 20 days throughout the bitter cold month of February, and an equally cold yet fascinating two-week Antarctic expedition to its Circle.\\nEn route, I’ve even found myself becoming a member of an 18-man local convoy enduring a 22-hour trip in northern Mali, from Gao to Timbuktu, perched atop a pick-up truck’s cargo.\\nBy water, I found a cheap last-minute Galapagos cruise in Puerto Ayora, later also passing 550 hours crossing the Amazon River by boat and while sleeping in a hammock for several months. The means are endless!\\nWhile traveling, I’ve learned it to be imperative to keep an open mind, to be prepared for and even embrace the unexpected as these experiences can offer invaluable life lessons. Following such a belief has led me to live six months in Istanbul, then another half-year in Lviv, Ukraine.\\nI once stumbled upon Jemaa el Fna square in Marrakech, finding it one of the craziest and most delightful places in the world! Putting stigma aside, I even rerouted to visit North Korea and, quite unexpectedly, ended up liking it a lot!\\nAnother day, I found myself taking bread baking classes in The Democratic Republic of Congo. Sure, why not?\\nYes, there can be downfalls to the Traveler’s rhythm, even danger. Precautionary measures must be readily accessible, and consciously aware, at all times and in places-unknown.\\nI’ve had guns aimed at me in Mauritania, Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Mali while, because of several travel-related misunderstandings, I’ve been detained by police in South Sudan, Spain, Mauritania, Barbados, Morocco, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Monaco, Uzbekistan, Germany, Nagorno-Karabakh, Lithuania, and Russia.\\nI’ve even been afflicted with malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo, taking 8 months to fully recover. Conversely, there are times when the experience obtained by setting aside one’s own fear is beyond rewarding. I can now say I’ve traversed the infamous Chernobyl Dead Zone, where the worst nuclear disaster in mankind’s history took place and departed unharmed.\\nFeeding wild hyenas in Ethiopia\\nWhy travel as a way of living?\\nSo, why travel as a way of living, if for even a short while, and not just take a holiday?\\nLife is made of moments and the World is out there full of precious and unique adventures waiting for us.\\nIn this way, you are incorporating the world into your own life and your life into the world while becoming a part of it and its global society, not only seeing it through a protective (or pixilated) glass window.\\nWherever you may find yourself along with your journey, aspects of life usually put on hold for a vacation remain, or return, as they are already a part of you.\\nAttributes such as work, spirituality, education, friendship, and even family resurface because they are human, existential needs and will somehow need to travel with you.\\nAlone, I’ve camped in the Kazakhstan mountains’ wilderness and even lived like a monk in a Nepalese Buddhist monastery. One of the best travel experiences I can recall was attending an authentic Amazigh triple-marriage in the Sahara Desert. Then, the unexpected reward can occur, like a century-old, evening ritual concluding by feeding hyenas in Ethiopia.\\nOf course, necessity sometimes brought about periods when pausing to work was imperative. Or, was it really a pause? I’ve worked on a farm in upstate New York, spent countless hours in six months compiling a list of 2300 travel blogs, then making it available online.\\nThe result\\nA growing list of notices and awards for the work, finding unexpected places while in search of work-driven answers, even arriving just-in-time to be the first travel blogger to enter the new country of South Sudan! Then, having the ability to reach out to you and share such advice and incredible stories as these – stimulating movement, awareness, and inspiration on a global scale.\\nIn summation, the most important aspect of travel, of Adventure, is that it is mind-expanding, offering free life lessons and lasting education. I remember New York, attending photography classes with world-famous photographer Steve McCurry, then taking part in a student exchange art program at SAMK (Satakunnan ammattikorkeakoulu) while living half a year in Finland.\\nAmong so many others, these opportunities prepared me for an unforgettable experience as a volunteer in Almaty, South Kazakhstan, where I was responsible for teaching self-expression through plastic arts, to 30 eager children.\\nAll of my personal studies, observations and experiences resulted in the ultimate exchange – moments when I can give back, seeing others’ same smiles I had when I began my journey, half a lifetime ago.\\nWe all carry our beliefs with us, the extent of our knowledge and opinions of people and the world. Whether discovered in a group, partaking in others’ rituals or finding one’s self alone in a moment of quietude after scaling a mountain, travel can truly reinforce and challenge our convictions greater than any experience.\\nWelcome to my adventure travel blog!\\nBest travel experiences\\nMy 52 best travel tips\\nVisited countries\\nWhat’s on my backpack\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Visit Timbuktu, Republic of Mali\\nVisit Timbuktu in Republic of Mali- Africa Travel Guide\\nTimbuktu is a place where you feel like you’re going back in time. It is one of the world’s epic cities and most desirable yet unreachable travel destinations. Lying at the edge of the Sahara Desert and the “Niger bend,” the strategic location of the city allowed it to become a powerful and prosperous link between West Africa and the Mediterranean. Past empires used the camel caravan route to make trade for centuries. Timbuktu grew into a center of propagation of Islam in the 15th and 16th century. Its mosques are part of the reason why UNESCO considered it a World Heritage Site.\\nLike myself, other travelers come to Timbuktu (Tombouctou) looking for the mysticism of the place. I explored the whole city, the central market, the monument of peace, sacred places such as the Djinguereber Mosque, the city museum, and local pastries. The architecture and color of Timbuktu are things which have always been on my mind.\\nRead my page: 52 Photos of Timbuktu the Mysterious.\\n2. Visit Marrakesh, Kingdom of Morocco\\nVisit Marrakesh, Kingdom of Morocco\\nMarrakesh is undoubtedly one of the best travel destinations in Morocco and in the whole world. Marrakesh is a must for those who’d like to find both cultural features and entertainment in an otherworldly city founded centuries ago by Berbers, and an ancient “entrepôt” for the merchandise brought from further south in Africa, via Timbuktu.\\nMarrakech is without a doubt one of the best places to visit in Africa. Filled with shops, old palaces and interesting museums, Marrakesh promises to keep you busy for several days. Do not miss the gardens of Menara, Marrakesh Museum, the Saadian Tombs and other incredible monuments. But the real “Red City,” the name was given after the red pigment on the walls, can be experienced in the old crowded medina’s and in Jemaa el-Fna square where drummers, musicians, acrobats, dancers, storytellers, and comedians create a frenetic ambiance. And anything else you can think of regarding street entertainment.\\nIn the UNESCO World Heritage medina of Marrakesh, the variety of the souks invites us to carry home a lot more than we’d like. Also worth exploring is the Ville Nouvelle, the modern part of the city, with its wide boulevards of cafés and trending boutiques leading to nice gardens that help ease the heat in the summer. After getting to know all sides of Marrakesh, it is time to continue your journey in Morocco heading south to the Sahara Desert. Marrakesh is one of the most visited cities in Africa. In 2017, for the first time in history, Marrakesh crossed the 2 million tourists and more than 6 million overnight stays.\\nRead my pages: a 3-day travel guide to visit Marrakesh and Djemaa El-Fna Marrakesh – Insanity beyond expectations.\\n3. Visit The Great Pyramid and The Sphinx in Cairo, Arab Republic of Egypt\\nVisit the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx in Cairo, Arab Republic of Egypt\\nThe Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx are located in Giza Necropolis, on the outskirts of Cairo. These World Wonders with 4600 years old totally change Cairo’s urban skyline towards the empty desert.\\nWith 146 m / 481 ft, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the most impressive manmade constructions on Earth. As we arrive, the place becomes more and more extraordinary. At dawn, sunset and after the night comes, the mysticism rises beyond what’s imaginable in this site, recognizable anywhere. Despite recent political problems, Egypt is still one of the most visited African countries.\\nThe Great Sphinx is big. Enormous. Standing close to this figure with the body of a lion and a human head, it gives you a different sense of your own size. Numerous tales and legends involve the Great Sphinx, its origin and “life.” No wonder, since it is the oldest known monumental sculpture in the world, thought to have been built by ancient Egyptians during the reign of the Pharaoh Khafra, who ruled the Old Kingdom between 2558 and 2532 BC.\\nRead my page: Visiting the Pyramids of Giza in Cairo – Ancient Egypt\\n4. Visit Lalibela, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\nVisit Lalibela, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\nLalibela is famous for its incredible UNESCO recognized rock carved churches from the medieval period, proof of the city’s relevance for Ethiopian Christianity, making it a place of pilgrimage and devotion still today. In fact, the layout and names of Lalibela’s buildings are considered by many a symbolic representation of Jerusalem.\\nRising at 2,500 m / 8200 ft above sea level, Lalibela is probably the nicest travel destination in Ethiopia. Besides the churches, the surrounding landscapes are beautiful and the houses are of traditional construction, with rounded stones with straw on top. It’s a pleasure to discover them walking around the cobblestone car free streets.\\nRead my page: 37 historical places to visit in Ethiopia\\n5. Visit Luxor, Arab Republic of Egypt\\nVisit Luxor, Egypt\\nLuxor is a beautiful city. For me, the best of my travel to Egypt. Divided between the two sides of the Nile River, it is the place where the tombs of Tutankhamun, Ramses IX, Seti I, Ramses VI and Horemheb were found. So, there is no History lacking here.\\nIn Luxor, you can visit famous monuments such as the Temple of Luxor, Karnak Temple, the unique and impressive mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut and the Temple of Medinet Habu. Just to name a few of the remarkable sites. I even made a hot air balloon trip through the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens to see the surroundings from the skies. That was incredible, everybody should do it.\\nRead my page: Luxor the World’s greatest open-air Museum.\\n6. Visit Ait Benhaddou, Kingdom of Morocco\\nVisit Ait Benhaddou, Kingdom of Morocco\\nKsar of Ait Benhaddou is an old adobe fortified village on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Located near Ouarzazate, on the Gate of Sahara Desert, Ait Benhaddou offers a great walk through mud made houses where people still live today.\\nMorocco is undoubtedly one best African countries to visit. Remember the films “Lawrence of Arabia”, “Sodom and Gomorrah”, “Jesus of Nazareth”, “Gladiator”? These and many others have used Ait Benhaddou as a set in some of their most emblematic scenes. Check them out before you head for the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.\\n7. Visit La Dune Rose, Republic of Mali\\nVisit La Dune Rose in Mali – Africa Best Destinations\\nNear the town of Gao, locally known as Koyma, there is this massive dune on the right bank of the River Niger. You can see it right from Gao, but the Dune Rose becomes more and more amazing as you approach it, especially at sunrise or sunset. This is when the sand turns pink and throws its magic all around. Literally, according to the people who live here.\\nOnce you get up on the sand dune, the views over the river and the whole region are breathtaking. Even better would be to take a pirogue and head to the water to check out the wildlife downstream.\\n8. Visit Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi, Republic of Kenya\\nVisit Nairobi’s Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, Republic of Kenya\\nThe Elephant and Rhino Nursery of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi is the place to visit if you are passionate about wildlife and animals in general. This animal shelter, located near Nairobi National Park, can be easily visited by anybody wanting to contact the animals and witness the beautiful work these people are doing. Visiting Africa can be hard, but places such as this one make the trip worth it.\\nSheldrick Wildlife Trust protects the habitats and rehabilitates elephants and rhinoceros from Nairobi and Tsavo National Park, mainly orphans whose mothers were killed. During morning visits you can watch friendly elephants being given milk by their tutors. Their friendship and trust are really evident when you see them play.\\nVideo about Kenya’s Elephants and The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust:\\nFor support or donations visit http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/.\\n9. Visit Erg Chebbi Dunes, Kingdom of Morocco\\nVisit Erg Chebbi Dunes, Kingdom of Morocco\\nHaving a surprisingly orange hue, the Erg Chebbi Dunes are one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been to. This incredible part of the Sahara desert in Morocco is the ideal place for a couple of days enjoying one of the best holiday destinations in the country. Explore the desert, go camel trekking, enjoy the sunrise and sunset, meet nomadic families around the dunes. The best time to visit Africa really depends on which country you want to go to. For example, you should not visit Merzouga during the peak of Summer.\\nMy highlights of things to do in the Erg Chebbi Dunes are, definitely, everything that involves getting into the mysticism of the place, being one with nature and slowing down to let it all sink in. Challenge yourself to climb the tallest dune — there is always one closer to the sky — and sit on top of your conquest. The calm wind will welcome you.\\nRead my page: Erg Chebbi dunes in the Sahara Desert\\n10. Visit Gao, Republic of Mali\\nVisit Gao in Mali – Africa Best Destinations\\nGao is situated on the left bank of River Niger, at the junction with the Tilemsi Valley, 320km / 200mi east-southeast of Timbuktu. It was once the capital of the Songhai Empire. Nowadays, Gao is the largest town in this region of Mali.\\nOne can think Gao is the end of the world since there’s nothing around, but the town can well be a starting point in your expedition to the Sahara Desert. Visit the busy port if you’re looking to see how trade is made here. Another thing not to miss in Gao is the beautiful Tomb of Askia, built by the Emperor of Songhai, Askia Mohamed, in 1495. The structure was considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for being a demonstration of the power and wealth the trade in salt and gold brought in the 15th and 16th centuries. Besides, it is also an excellent example of the West African Sahel’s tradition of monumental mud-building.\\n11. Visit Harar, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\nVisit Harar, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\nHarar was, for me, after Lalibela, the best of Ethiopia. I just loved, loved this Muslim town with dusty streets and colorful markets packed with genuinely friendly people. Wondering around makes you feel like you got caught in a time machine and sent back to the middle ages.\\nStanding tall on a plateau with savannah and deserts surrounding it, the fortified historic town of Harar Jugol has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2006. It is the 4th holiest city of Islam, which becomes evident when you realize it contains 82 mosques and 102 shrines altogether. But don’t look for them all. Instead, find them by accident as you go for a stroll inside the storytelling walls before you visit the outskirts in search of an up-close personal contact with wild hyenas.\\nRead my page: Feeding Hyenas in Ethiopia.\\n12. Visit Faradje, Democratic Republic of the Congo\\nVisit Faradje, Democratic Republic of the Congo\\nFaradje was the second city I visited in RD Congo. It is located in the Haut-Uele District, on the Dungu River, a soundless place.\\nI slept in front of the house of the chief of police. I used his house to watch a little TV with his family and took a bath in his house bathroom. The morning market in Faradje is very nice and gives you an idea of what it is to live in a small rural town in Congo.\\n13. Visit Mopti, Republic of Mali\\nVisit Mopti in Mali – Africa Best Destinations\\nMopti is a town in the confluence of the Niger and the Bani Rivers, in Mali, 460km / 285mi northeast of Bamako. At this location, the charm of a busy, truly African port is evident. Everything happens here. On the opposite margin of the Niger, a few small fishing villages add to the interest of the region as a mean to get to know the population of Mali. And the amazing Pays Dogon is not far away either!\\nIn the center of Mopti, The Great Mosque (or Komoguel Mosque) resembles the well-known Great Mosque of Djenné, built with sun-dried mud bricks. Its Sudano-Sahelian architecture really leaves an impression on us.\\n14. Visit Gorée Island, Republic of Senegal\\nGoree Island, Republic of Senegal\\nGorée Island has a very picturesque town and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Possibly the most beautiful urban destination in Senegal, Gorée Island is about 40 minutes by boat ride away from Dakar, the capital of the country. The Portuguese navigator Dinis Dias discovered it in 1444. Between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was the largest center of the slave trade in Africa. During these times, the Portuguese, English, Dutch and French all ruled this territory.\\nIn addition to the houses and interesting architecture, there are still many places to visit such as the Fortress of Gorée Island and the site of the old English cannon. The island is a living memory of the human exploitation that occurred here, but also a strong reminder that reconciliation can take place. Since it was listed by the colonial administration, in 1944, Gorée Island has had no major construction, making it a well-preserved place to visit.\\nRead my page: People of Gambia and Senegal\\n15. Visit Juba, Republic of South Sudan\\nVisit Juba, South Sudan\\nJuba is the capital of the most recent African country. Funny that, when I was arriving in Juba, by bus, someone asked me “Look out of the window, can you see Juba?”. I saw nothing else but trees and a rocky mountain.\\nJuba is a city without any infrastructures. For that reason, and a few others, the government is considering the idea of establishing the capital of South Sudan elsewhere. If you’re considering where to visit in Africa, probably Juba will not be on the top of your list.\\nIn Juba, you can visit the church, the new parliament and the mausoleum of Dr. John Garang Mabior. And, of course, move around town rejoicing for being one of the few foreigners visiting this new country.\\nRead my page: Backpacking Guide to South Sudan.\\n16. Visit Hombori, Republic of Mali\\nVisit Hombori in Mali – Africa Best Destinations\\nHambori is a tiny town in the Cercle of Douentza, in the Mopti Region of Mali. Even though its origins are unknown, including its exact age, the truth is that this ancient village of the Dogon people became the home of the Songhai Empire after the Almoravides invaded the regions around. It then acted, many years later, as a strategic point to the conquest of southern Mali.\\nThe architecture in Hambori is both simple and beautiful. Houses are built of rocks and they communicate through alleyways and tunnels. In the vicinity, there are incredible rock formations, including the Needles of Gami, very popular to go climbing.\\n17. Visit Laas Geel, Republic of Somaliland\\nVisit Laas Geel, Republic of Somaliland\\nLaas Geel consists of breathtaking outdoor rock paintings located 50km / 31mi from the city of Hargeisa, in Somaliland. This incredible place was the highlight of my trip to this region of the Horn of Africa.\\nIn Laas Geel there are several murals with man-made paintings with over 9000 years old. Humans, dogs, giraffes, cows are portrayed with muddy colors. Some of them are as big as 1m / 3.2ft in length, and it is amazing how they can be in such excellent condition. Somalia is one of the cheapest African countries to visit.\\nRead my page: Exhaustive Travel Guide to Somaliland.\\n18. Visit Bakau, Republic of the Gambia\\nVisit Bakau, Republic of the Gambia\\nBakau is just west of Banjul, Gambia’s capital city, on the Atlantic coast. It has turned into the most developed town in the whole country since the government decided to give it a facelift, as people were starting to move out of Banjul. But the very foundation of Bakau is thought to have been around the sacred crocodile pool, Kachikally.\\nInside de pool of Bakau Kachikally there are now about 100 sacred crocodiles. Some people believe that the basin has healing and supernatural powers and a bath with crocodiles in that water can help increase fertility. We can go into the pool and even touch the crocodiles. If we dare… Other than this obvious attraction in Bakau, we can also visit the botanical gardens, Kachikally Museum and the beaches at Cape Point.\\n19. Visit Chinguetti, Islamic Republic of Mauritania\\nVisit Chinguetti, Islamic Republic of Mauritania\\nChinguetti is a historic caravan town built among the dunes of the Sahara Desert in Mauritania. Founded in the 12th Century not far from an earlier oasis settlement, which has now been swallowed by the sand, the town became a roundup point for pilgrims on the way to Mecca, gaining increasing religious importance. Its trading role also made it prosper up until the apogee, in the 17th-19th centuries.\\nThe ksar of Chinguetti is part of the UNESCO World Heritage list (together with the ksar of Ouadane, Tichitt and Oualata). This is a mysterious place, where you can visit the old town, the old mosque, and libraries. Traditional houses with patios lie in narrow streets around the squared minaret mosque. Getting lost in this labyrinth is simply delicious.\\nRead my page: Photos of people from Mauritania.\\n20. Visit La Main de Fatma, Republic of Mali\\nVisit La Main de Fatma in Mali – Africa Best Destinations\\nLa Main de Fatma is an impressive rocky mountain massif in Mount Hombori, in the Mopti Region of Mali. Near the small town of Hombori and about 100km / 160mi of Douentza, La Main de Fatma is, in fact, an enormous rock wall standing high in the middle of a flat desert. Its name, of course, was given because its five peaks resemble the five fingers of a hand, maybe Fatma’s, the daughter of the Prophet Mohamed. Audacious climbers head to these rocks looking for a challenge. Others come for the views.\\n« Best Destinations in Africa by other Travel Bloggers»\\nI asked other travel bloggers about their favorite places to visit Africa.

Totally worth visiting. West of the river is where one of the most famous monuments is – the Valley of the Kings, where incredible tombs of the likes of Tutankhamun can be found. Wait, there’s more, the Valley of Queens, Hatshepsut’s amazing temple, and the Ramesseum, just to name a few.\\nWith its remarkable history and monuments, Luxor is one of my favorite places to visit and offers new things to explore all the time.\\nFollow Breathe With Us\\n» Blog Breathe With Us\\n» Twitter Breathe With Us\\n» Instagram Breathe With Us\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

What do you want to find or what are you searching for while visiting other countries?\\nThe story of my journeys started back in 2013. Due to the difficulty in getting an entrance visa for Iranians, caused by sanctions against my country, I still managed to go out and start traveling.\\nAt first, I was excited to visit historic sites with a particular interest in museums. Still, after a while, I became interested in nature as well.\\nBesides, I love gastronomy tourism, as I love cooking. About the language, I always started to get familiar with the local lingo before the travel. For example, before I go to Italy, I took a three months course in the Italian language. That decision was beneficial in communicating with people during my stay.\\nMany travelers are strongly affected by previous journeys, certain people they met, the different cultures they encounter, and special experiences on the road. What is your most memorable trip and why? You can write about more than one trip if you wish.\\nTraveling to Austria was my first experience in Europe.

Proudly, we showed ours, and tragedy happened. Those tickets were specific to animals, and the result was a 100 euro penalty.\\nThe most remarkable experience for me was the European’s civilized behavior in their daily life. Like eating healthy foods and being worry about their health. Respecting other’s priority in public transportation or, in general.\\nSome people need to be encouraged to leave home, to lose their fear of traveling. What advice can you give to someone who wants to start traveling but doesn’t know how, when and why?\\nIt was so hard to start traveling alone at the beginning. I remember my first international journey to Malaysia.\\nI think the first travel is enough to fall in love with exploring different places. You need to forget everything about your home country and focus on the destination with an open mind. Travelling is like an addicting game.\\nYou need to make decisions for every element while on the road.\\nBeing well aware of the different aspects of travel itself. Do you want to relax, adventure, or history? Take into account your personality and preferences.\\nChoosing your travel partners. Who would you like to travel with? On your own? With your family?

After (or before) enjoying the sun on the beach, go culture-hunting visiting the Roman ruins near the Church of Santa Maria Assunta.\\nAmalfi\\nAmalfi town was an important independent maritime republic dominating the trade between the Byzantine Empire and Egypt. Its importance was consolidated by the prestigious maritime law boards called “Tavole Amalfitane” prevalent throughout the Middle Ages.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nAntarctica Cruise Ship\\nAnyone who’s been bitten by the travel bug and feels adventurous is undoubtedly fascinated by Antarctica. Once there, any traveler feels small, taking the pulse of Nature’s real power, thoroughly understanding the meaning of “remote.” It’s our Planet’s supreme expression of grandeur: the white vastness of snow and ice, the contrasting deep dark blue of the ocean, the proximity to the wildlife that practically roams freely.\\nIt’s no wonder that there are so many travel enthusiasts who want to visit Antarctica despite the challenges: the high cost of such a trip, the rough sea crossing, and the weather that even in the summers can be quite unkind.\\nAntarctica Cruise Ship Expedition\\nAntarctica Cruise Ship Expedition\\nTraveling the least explored of the continents on board of a cruise ship is a dream for many. Antarctica is a continent located in the southernmost tip of the globe, which contains the South Pole.\\nAntarctica is technically a continent. A landmass larger than Europe, almost entirely covered in ice, centered on the South Pole, perhaps the most remote location of planet Earth.\\nPort Lockroy\\nAntarctica is surrounded by three oceans: Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian. It’s a completely different scenery from what you’d see in the Arctic (which is actually a frozen ocean surrounded by continents).\\nPractically unknown and unexplored until the end of the 19th century, it began to be explored and studied in the 20th century. It doesn’t belong to any country and it’s administered by the institutions created after the Antarctica Treaty System in 1959, signed by countries that intended to claim parts of the territory.\\nMy experience in Antarctica\\nParadise Harbour in Antarctica\\nI visited Antarctica in February. Going on such a trip is a unique experience that I wish all of you can experience at least once in your lives. And I hope to contribute to that helping you with the information I’ll gather here. It’s not complicated to plan a trip to such a remote destination, but you have to do some research and, considering I’ve done it already, I’ve decided to help you with part of that work.\\nThis Antarctica Cruise Ship took me to the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands for 15 days, leaving the Argentine city of Ushuaia across the Drake Passage, down to 68°11 S 67°00 W in Stonington Island, beyond the Antarctic Circle.\\nI spent a reasonable amount of money, of course, because there isn’t a truly affordable way to explore the frozen continent. But the return I got from each cent I invested on that trip was absolutely worth it.\\nMy Antarctica Expedition was on board the Ocean Diamond, a cruise ship prepared for the ice, which has hundreds of trips both in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\\nDeception Island\\nDuring the Antarctica Cruise, I visited many places around the Peninsula region and also the South Shetland Islands. The trip itself was wonderful, exceeding all kinds of expectations.\\nStunning scenery and indeed an adventure expedition. Besides land incursions and several trips by speedboat across the continent, I still had 15 days of learning about Antarctica. Onboard the ship, I had daily lectures and conferences to develop knowledge about Antarctica, its geology, history, flora, and fauna.\\nBesides the team of experts, onboard the Antarctica Cruise I yet had the pleasure to have been traveling in the company of Falcon Scott (grandson of explorer Robert Falcon Scott) and Jonathan Shackleton (cousin of the explorer Ernest Henry Shackleton).\\nItinerary of 15 days Antarctica Cruise\\nDay 1 – Ushuaia, Argentina\\nDay 2 – Embarkation in Ushuaia, Argentina\\nDay 3 – Crossing the Drake Passage\\nDay 4 – At Sea to Antarctica\\nDay 5 – The Circle & Horseshoe Island\\nDay 6 – Stonington Island\\nDay 7 – Petermann Island\\nDay 8 – Port Lockroy & Cuverville Island\\nDay 9 – Neko Harbour & Paradise Harbour\\nDay 10 – Danco Island & Wilhelmina Bay\\nDay 11 – Cuverville Island\\nDay 12 – Deception & Half Moon Island\\nDay 13 – The Drake Passage to Ushuaia\\nDay 14 – The Drake Passage to Ushuaia\\nDay 15 – Disembark in Ushuaia, Argentina\\nAntarctic Circle\\nAdelaide Island in Antarctica\\nDuring the Antarctica expedition, I crossed beyond the 66º South ie, the imaginary line that enters the so-called Antarctic Circle. The southernmost I went was down to 68º in Stonington Island, southeast of Adelaide Island in Marguerite Bay.\\nAt the exact moment crossing 66º, around 5:30 am, there were 2 large icebergs floating through the Southern Ocean, just aside the ship. Amazing.\\nAntarctic Circle\\nThe best time to take a cruise to Antarctica is during the Antarctic summer months, ie during the months of December, January, and February. Before or after these dates is a little out of season to have good weather and see many animals.\\nAnimals in Antarctica\\nAnimals in Antarctica\\nI love animals, and during this 15 day Antarctica Cruise I saw many beautiful wild animals in their natural habitat.\\nMy favorite is leopard seals, but whales and all sorts of penguins are also amazing.\\nDuring the trip to Antarctica I was fortunate enough to be able to spot all these animals: Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), Crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), Leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus), Snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea), Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus), Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), Antarctic prion (Pachyptila desolata) and killer whale (Orcinus orca)\\nOnboard of Ocean Diamond\\nOcean Diamond Antarctica cruise ship\\nMy trip to Antarctica was on board of the ship 124 m / 406 ft length, Ocean Diamond. This ship is operated by Quark Expeditions to make trips both in the Arctic and Antarctica. The cruise ship departed from Ushuaia in February 2014. The original tour I bought to Quark Expeditions was the 15 Days Crossing the Circle Southern Expedition. But since the first day is in Ushuaia, and I was there already, my trip only really started the next day. I got a Last Minute Cruise to Antarctica in Ushuaia one week before departure.\\nOcean Diamond is an Eco cruise ship that offers certified Carbon Neutral voyages. Although it takes 189 passengers, you don’t really feel there’s that much people on board. It’s actually not that much people really, comparing to other huge cruise ships carrying 4000 people. Onboard of Ocean Diamond there’s one restaurant, one souvenir ship, the biggest floating polar library in the World, a theater-style auditorium, a clinic with licensed doctor and a Gym Center. Now you have some photos of the ship’s different decks.\\n1. Stern view in Captain’s Deck\\nOcean Diamond Antarctica Cruise – Upper deck\\n2.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nAntarctica travel guide\\nAntarctica Travel Guide\\nAntarctica is an astounding travel destination, though most people would love to go there but don’t know what experiences are possible within the Antarctic continent itself.\\nTraveling 15 days inside an Antarctica cruise ship gave me superlative insight of its geography, regional flora and fauna, and its history. On this page is a list of Antarctica’s best destinations.\\nDanco Island in Antarctica\\nHow to get to Antarctica, when to go, what to pack, how to choose the best trip for you, what to see there, what experiences to have. Those are some of the topics you’ll have to research before embarking on your grand adventure, and I have the answers to all those questions.\\nAntartica continent profile\\nFlag of Antarctica\\nLocation: Antarctic region in the Southern Hemisphere\\nBorders: Surrounded by the Southern Ocean\\nSub-regions: British Antarctic Territory, Ross Dependency, Adélie Land, Peter I Island, Australian Antarctic Territory, Queen Maud Land, Chilean Antarctic Territory, Argentine Antarctica and the Marie Byrd Land (not claimed)\\nArea: 14,000,000 km2\\nPopulation: 1,000 in winter – 5,000 in the summer\\nDiscovered: First sighted in 1820 by the Russian expedition of Mikhail Lazarev and Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen\\nMap of Antarctica – Antarctic continent\\nHow to get to Antarctica\\nUSHUAIA ARGENTINA\\nTo visit Antarctica, you first have to reach one of the ports from where cruise ships depart to the frozen continent.\\nSome cruises depart from other locations, such as Australia and New Zealand, but they’re long trips and extremely expensive for most of us.\\nMost people travel to the most southern point of South America and board a cruise ship from there, reaching Antarctica in about two or three days.\\nIn Chile, ships depart from Punta Arenas, but trips to Antarctica are more frequent from Ushuaia, in Argentina.\\nThat said, you first have to travel to the capital city of one of these countries, most likely Buenos Aires. You can fly to Ushuaia from there. A one-way ticket costs about 100 to 150 Euros. You can also travel by bus, across different regions in Argentina including Patagonia. You’ll travel 3,100 Km in about nine days if you wish to hop off the bus to enjoy the journey. The bus trip will probably be more expensive than the flight, but it’s a more memorable experience.\\nIf you prefer to travel non-stop to your destination, the trip is about 48-hours long including a bus change in Rio Gallegos and a border crossing (you have to enter Chile and exit again to enter Ushuaia).\\nOnce you reach Ushuaia or Punta Arenas, take some days off to relax and visit the area. These are uniquely beautiful destinations, with a lot of activities. Keep in mind that accommodation and food are not exactly cheap around here.\\nWhen to Visit Antarctica?\\nAlmirante Brown Base in Antartica\\nYou can’t visit Antarctica all year long. There’s a rather small window from November to March, when is summer in Antarctica. That’s the only time of year when ships can travel through the ice, although there are some cruises making a few trips in October.\\nWithin this time frame, choosing the best time is a matter of personal preference. In December and January, days are longer, and the sun shines for about 20 hours.\\nWhat’s the Weather Like in Antarctica\\nWeather in Antarctica\\nWeather in Antarctica\\nMost people are afraid to embark on an adventure because of their preconceptions of what’s the weather like in Antarctica. I should clarify that in the summer the weather can be quite pleasant there and definitely bearable for most people.\\nOn the Antarctica coastal areas, the ones you’ll visit, the average yearly temperature is -10 degrees Celsius. But remember this is an average, influenced by the -40 degrees Celsius you’d experience in the winter and other temperatures recorded further south from where you’re traveling to.\\nBesides, all the expeditions happen during the Antarctic summer, when the temperature is sometimes a mild 12 degrees Celsius and subzero temperatures are practically unheard of.\\nThe days are long and, if you’re lucky, mostly sunny. In fact, the Antarctica skies are clearer the further you travel inland. Considering that the expeditions usually travel around the coast, expect cloudy skies with the occasional opening to see some blue and some sunlight.\\nVisit Neko Harbour in Artarctica\\nThe good thing about Antarctica, weather-wise, is you’ll have great visibility. Weather permitting, you can spot mountains over 500 km away! The low temperatures and strong winds keep the atmosphere clean and bright and also enable exceptional acoustics.\\nOut of curiosity, the average yearly temperature is -60 degrees Celsius in the highest parts of the continent! Can you imagine? In average! And by the way, the Antarctic holds the record for the lowest temperature ever recorded. At the Vostok Station, on 21 July 1983, the thermometers registered -89.2 degrees Celsius.\\nVisit Antarctica in November\\nVisit Antarctica in November\\nIf you’re fascinated by icebergs, November is the best month to travel to Antarctica. This is the time when the glaciers are at their prime shape, without traces of mud that will show up later. December and January aren’t bad months to see these vast masses of ice, but November is the best one.\\nNovember and March are the most affordable months to travel to Antarctica, especially in the beginning of the month.\\nOn the other hand, the cold is intense, and you won’t see much of the wildlife. It’s mating season for penguins and sea lions, and you might spot a few penguin chicks and sea lion pups.\\nThe ice is still thick, which makes traveling to some locations impossible before the peak of summer. On the other hand, the places you will be able to visit are clean and untouched, which will change as the season moves forward. At that time, it will be covered in mud and footprints.\\nIt’s the best season if you want to take part in some overland expeditions, climbing the Vinson Massif (4,892 m) for example or camping to observe emperor penguins.\\nVisit Antarctica in December\\nVisit Antarctica in December\\nAs of the start of December, temperatures slowly rise to above zero levels. Icebergs are still spectacular and days grow longer, giving you more time to observe nature around you.\\nFrom mid-month, you’ll start noticing the young penguins. Chances of spotting them increase in December and you’ll also be able to see some sea lion pups.\\nA lot of people say December is the best time of the year to visit Antarctica, especially around the second half, when the intense cold practically disappears. However, it’s also the time of year when prices increase and a last-minute trip can cost too much, and when there are more people visiting and more ships at sea.\\nVisit Antarctica in January\\nVisit Antarctica in January\\nIn January you’ll still be able to see massive icebergs. You’ll spot more penguin chicks and probably some young seals too. It’s a great time of year for increased chances of spotting whales traveling in large herds.\\nTemperatures are usually above zero degrees, and the sun shines for 20 hours a day. Ice is not a problem to navigate, and you can reach the top must-see places without hassle.\\nJanuary is one of the most expensive months to visit Antarctica because alongside December, it’s known as the best time to travel to this part of the world.\\nPlaces you can visit on land become crowded, and the busy wildlife leaves their mark in very noticeable ways. The smell will be intense, so factor this before traveling if you’re sensitive to unpleasant scents.\\nVisit Antarctica in February\\nVisit Antarctica in February\\nFebruary marks the beginning of the end of the Antarctic summer, the transition season, the beginning of a new year. Days become shorter and colder, especially in the second half of the month.\\nFebruary is a fabulous month to observe penguins. The newborn chicks need all the care and attention from their parents, busy running around looking for food for their young ones. This is also a good month for whale watchers. In fact, this is probably the best time of the year to spot whales before they begin their long migration. It’s a good time to see seals and their pups goofing around too, pure entertainment for travelers.\\nIf you’re planning to cross the Antarctic Polar Circle, it’s easier in February when you’ll have much better conditions to do so.\\nVisit Antarctica in March\\nVisit Antarctica in March\\nMarch is the last month you can travel to Antarctica. Everything changes after that: the unbearable cold takes over the frozen continent, the night takes over the day and there’s little sunlight, and local wildlife reduces its activities to almost a full stop.\\nHowever, you can still visit Antarctica in March. The trip will be the cheapest you’ll ever get, and you’ll positively see whales. From March to April, it’s the best time of year to see whales.\\nHow to Visit Antarctica on a Budget\\nZodiac trips in Antarctica\\nThere’s no workaround, trips to Antarctica are indeed expensive. They will always cost more than any other trip you take.\\nFirst, you have to remember that it’s a remote destination and that we have to travel to the cruises’ departure ports, which are also on remote locations especially if you’re traveling from Europe.\\nSecond, there are only two ways to reach Antarctica, and none of them is cheap: either by flying (on a plane or a helicopter) or by ship.\\nNaturally, considering these circumstances, the cost is a source of concern for the bold traveler who dreams of seeing those incredible frozen landscapes and the fascinating resident wildlife one day.\\nThere’s only one way to score a cheap trip to Antarctica: risking getting a last-minute package. And if you manage to get one for the first or last days of the Antarctic summer, even better. A last-minute deal could mean savings of 30% to 60%.\\nOkay, but what exactly do I mean by last minute? Well, it’s not literally one hour before departure, nor a day before. When it comes to trips to Antarctica, last-minute deals happen one to two weeks before the expedition starts.\\nYou can browse the Internet for these promotions, but you’ll have better chances if you go straight to one of the travel agencies in Punta Arenas or Ushuaia – assuming you’ll depart from there to explore the frozen continent.\\nThere’s also a chance that your accommodation keeps a board updated with the best and most recent promotions.\\nPlease note that it will still be an expensive trip, considering the discount is on the most expensive products: cabins with fewer passengers or cruises that last longer or have more activities.\\nThe downside of this strategy is not knowing when you’re traveling. You should reach the departure port a few weeks ahead and actively search for the best deals, without knowing if you’ll ever find something that matches your budget or your expectations. Especially if you’re traveling during high season.\\nThis is not a recommended option if you’re pressed for time or if you’ve already booked your return flight.\\nFinally, you must weigh the costs of an extended stay at the departure port. Ushuaia, for example, is an expensive city. You’ll have to account for food and accommodation, which is still a cost even if what you save in the end is worth it.\\nAntarctica Last-minute deals\\nVisit Stonington Island in Antarctica\\nIf you have your mind set on a last-minute deal, here’s a method you can follow:\\nReach Ushuaia or Punta Arenas in mid-October or early February. Keep in mind that travel agencies put up their last-minute deals 15 to 10 days before departure date.\\nFind affordable accommodation.\\nDefine what kind of trip you’re looking for and how much you are willing to pay for it.\\nEstablish a daily routine of going to travel agencies, the tourist office, and talking to people at your accommodation.\\nIf nothing changes, I suggest you try it again one week before your preferred departure date. If your dates are in November, you have lower chances of getting a cheap trip.\\nOn the other hand, you can look for a last-minute deal without traveling to the departure port too far in advance. Some people say you’ll lose money, but it’s not that different.\\nWhere to look?\\nOn Polar Cruises, for example, where you can do a general search of the cruises leaving to Antarctica.\\nPolar Cruises\\nOther agencies you can contact:\\nAntarctica Ushuaia Tourism\\nFree Style Adventure Travel\\nAnd here are some shipping companies you can contact directly. Try subscribing to their mailing lists. But beware that the best deals are sold out quickly and never be included in that mailing list.\\nChimu Adventures\\nQuark Expeditions\\nG Adventures\\nAurora Expeditions\\nPolar Cruises\\nExpeditions Online\\nAntarctica Travels\\nExpedition Trips\\nOcean Wide Expeditions\\nIf you want to plan ahead, you still have some chances to score a deal. Subscribe to mailing lists a few months before the Antarctica cruise season. Sixty to thirty days before operations start, there’s usually a wave of promotions that might include what you’re hoping for.\\nDon’t forget\\nKeep in mind that although cruise itineraries are planned in advance and approved by the territory’s administration, in Antarctica it’s the weather that makes the rules. So be prepared for changes or even having activities and tours canceled.\\nKeep in mind that a cheaper trip doesn’t always mean it’s the best option. For example, if you bought a six-day trip but the ship is slow and takes four days to reach Antarctica, you’ll only have two days left to explore and visit the continent. If the weather is terrible, you might not even be able to go on land.\\nMy tip is to buy a carefully chosen package that’s a little more expensive and with the larger number of days possible\\nTry selecting a costly expedition for a lower price.\\nThe Explorers of Antarctica\\nFalcon Scott grandson of the explorer Robert Falcon Scott\\nWe’ll never know for sure who was the first person to reach Antarctica. Most likely the Polynesian indigenous people, whose achievements are narrated on the folk tales that pass on from generation to generation.\\nThroughout the 17th century, several European voyagers touched Antarctica, including some Portuguese. But Captain James Cook was the first to cross the Antarctic Polar Circle and to complete a trip around the frozen continent between 1772 and 1775.\\nDiscovering new lands, never before seen by anyone or challenging to reach by local people, became an obsession during the 19th century, known as the explorers’ golden age. The scientific community was on fire then. Geography societies grew and spread across Europe, the mysteries of Africa’s inland territories, the depths of the ocean, the secrets of the deserts. All those topics stirred intellectual conversations all over Europe and North America. Jules Verne’s work and books such as “Around the World in 80 Days” are a perfect example of that state of mind.\\nThe extremely hostile weather of Antarctica, and the Arctic as well, meant that those vast areas would be the last to be explored, mapped, and studied.\\nThe Explorers of Antarctica\\nThe Explorers of Antarctica\\nDr. John Murray’s presentation in 1893 kickstarted the great age of exploring Antarctica. At his conference called “The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration,” at the Royal Geographical Society in London, the scholar pointed out that studying the frozen southern continent should be a priority for the international scientific community. Shortly after that, an expedition departed from Belgium, led by a local Navy officer, Captain Adrian de Gerlache. His ship, Belgique, was stuck in ice and the Belgian crew became the first to, involuntarily, spend one winter in that hostile land. Their journey took them to unchartered places, many of those accessible to most tourists that nowadays visit aboard modern cruise ships.\\nThe British Southern Cross Expedition was another remarkable excursion that departed in 1898 and traveled for two years. The crew spent the winter in the frozen continent and used dogs and sleds to explore vast Antarctica, becoming the first group of men to reach further south and pinpoint the exact location of the magnetic pole.\\nThen the Discovery Expedition followed, led by Robert Falcon Scott, also known as Captain Scott, who traveled in Antarctica between 1901 and 1904. He reached further south than the men before and charted many geographical features for the first time.\\nThe Explorers of Antarctica\\nThe Explorers of Antarctica\\nIn addition to those consecutive British expeditions, other countries organized scientific exploration journeys at the beginning of the 20th century. Germany sent a ship in 1901, that got stuck in ice and couldn’t travel or explore further. A Swedish expedition’s boat shipwrecked and the crew was saved by an Argentinian ship. France sent their first expedition in 1903, led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot, successfully mapping the region. Between 1908 and 1910, a second French expedition resumed the excellent work of their forerunners, discovering new places such as Marguerite Bay (or Margaret Bay) and the islands of Charcot (or Charcot Land), Renaud, and Rothschild.\\n1910 was a particularly outstanding year in the history of explorations in Antarctica. Two expeditions left Europe with the ambitious goal of reaching the South Pole. One of them was Norwegian, led by Roald Amundsen, an experienced explorer who had been a part of the Belgian expedition and the Southern Cross Expedition. The other one was British and led by Captain Scott.\\nIt was clear this was a competition, an actual race to the South Pole. The Norwegian won, arriving on 14 December 1911, and returning safely but under brutal weather conditions.\\nAs for the British, they arrived 33 days later but tragically died on their attempt to return home, probably of hunger and extreme cold.\\nMore expeditions followed, exploring the area, reaching places that had never been reached before, improving the scientific community’s knowledge of the frozen continent. Countless explorers had incredible experiences, and the stories about drama and survival multiplied.\\nIn 1922, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition ended abruptly with the death of Shackleton. That would be the end of the golden age of exploring Antarctica, also known as the Heroic Age.\\nNot much happened for some time, and it wasn’t until 1927 that an important step was taken forward to “conquer” Antarctica: the first exploratory flight over the continent. That marks the beginning of the Mechanical Age.\\nHalf Moon Island in Antarctica\\nMany territorial claims over Antarctica happened in the years between the two World Wars. World nations used the same colonial logic on Antarctica, especially the United Kingdom that followed an ambitious policy, without much opposition from France, Germany, and Norway. This was a source of concern to the South-American countries closer to Antarctica, Chile and Argentina, that weren’t pleased with the way things were unfolding.\\nBoth countries took advantage of the beginning of World War II to establish bases in Antarctica and mark their territorial aspirations.\\nDuring World War II, the United Kingdom considerably strengthened its presence in Antarctica, fearing the Chilean and Argentinian claims, and the use of the territory by the Germans. An unfounded concern that, nevertheless, made the country create a network of bases that were eventually abandoned or converted into scientific stations after the war.\\nThe end of the world war didn’t end the frictions between the United Kingdom and the South-American countries, though, and one more country would join in to stir the pot: the United States of America.\\nBetween 1957 and 1958, the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition led by Dr. Vivian Fuchs made the first continental crossing of Antarctica. The 12 men in the expedition traveled 3,473 km in 99 days, using six mechanical vehicles (three Sno-Cats, two Weasels, and an adapted Muskeg truck).\\nParadise Harbour in Antarctica\\nAs for the political tensions, it was fortunately under control and led to the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 (also known as the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, for short). It was signed by the 12 countries with an active presence or a strategic interest in Antarctica: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Those countries had established 50 bases in ice-cold Antarctica in total. There are currently 53 countries involved in the treaty, including Portugal, holding different statuses.\\nAntarctica Practical Tips – Before you go\\nVisit Neko Harbour in Artarctica\\n1. What to Wear in Antarctica\\nFor first timers, coming up with an Antarctica Packing List can be hard. It’s only natural to feel overwhelmed when it’s time to pack for such a unique trip. After all, for most travelers, this is a one-time adventure and they’re not quite sure what they’ll be up against.\\nOne of the most common misconceptions is to picture Antarctica as an unwelcoming frozen land, where it’s always cold, and you’ll constantly worry about freezing to death. Well, it is all that but not when you’re visiting. That’s another Antarctica, one that’s more remote and described like that in the winter. What you’ll find is a much more welcoming land, with temperatures around 0 degrees Celsius. Not much different from what you experience in the north of Europe in the fall or winter, if you’ve traveled there before.\\nPlease note that there are like two parallel universes on a trip to Antarctica: the comfortable ship and your cabin, and the stark environment on deck and when you go out to observe wildlife.\\nWhat to pack on your trip to Antarctica\\nLet’s begin with a packing list that, of course, you should adjust to your needs. Think of it as an idea, a source of inspiration for your own packing list. And remember to check if there’s a baggage allowance on the ship where you’ll be traveling to Antarctica.\\nWindbreaker. You can pack one, but the tour organizers will most likely give you one for free. A bright-colored one so you can stand out in the ice.\\nEveryday clothes. Let’s start with some good long johns, preferably made of merino wool. They’re more expensive, but the quality is worth the money. Ideally, pack two pairs. Pack enough t-shirts to change every day, or whatever you can carry. Long sleeve t-shirts to wear under heavier coats and sweaters. Remember you’ll be on the ship for most of your time, where you can dress casually. Pack comfortable clothes that you’d wear at home, like jeans and comfortable shoes.\\nWarm clothes. Pack as many warm socks as you can, just in case. Socks get wet quickly and keeping your feet dry and warm is crucial. One cap or two just in case, to prevent heat loss through your head, which is essential to keep warm in cold weather. Waterproof gloves and a scarf big enough to protect your neck and your face. I suggest you pack double the number of items you had in mind. Losing one of them can drastically affect your comfort, whereas packing extras won’t add much weight.\\nGaloshes. Useful when it’s time to go on land. Speed boats get wet, and you’ll spend some time in a damp environment. In addition to that, you might also step on water when getting off the ship. If you choose to pack your own galoshes, make sure they’re good quality with reinforced isolation. It’s most likely that the tour organizers will provide passengers with galoshes, but make sure you double check with them first. My boat had boots available so I didn’t need to worry about this.\\nWaterproof pants. Not only passengers might get wet while traveling in the speed boats, but ice is water and Antarctica is all ice. And no one wants to travel around with wet legs. Some people prefer snow pants, but they’re not easy to put on and take off. Light waterproof pants are more flexible.\\nSunscreen. Many people forget something as important as sunscreen when they take this trip. They are indeed traveling to the land of cold and ice. However, the sun here is the same sun in a tropical destination, even more intense when it bounces off the white surface.\\nPhoto equipment. Your choice of camera, be it an SLR, a compact, or a mirrorless. Even a good quality smartphone will do to capture the unforgettable moments you’ll most likely experience in Antarctica but remember you won’t get a second chance, so invest in something that you won’t regret later if something doesn’t go according to plan. Tip: bring something for the worst-case scenario, like losing the charger or the battery, or dropping your camera in the water. Being unable to photograph this unique experience will be even worse than the material loss.\\nA waterproof bag to carry the essential stuff for your very wet expeditions.\\nThermal protection for your water bottle. You won’t want to get ice instead of water when you feel thirsty, although in the warmer months you won’t likely need it.\\nBinoculars to observe wildlife, be it from the ship or during the expeditions on land.\\nSunglasses, because the sun in Antarctica is glaring and intense for many hours, amplified by all the white around you. Ski goggles are a good idea.\\nSwimwear. Consider packing a swimsuit. You might want to do something crazy in the ice or enjoy the hot water pool in your ship if it has one.\\nA basic medical kit that fits your needs, but don’t forget to include seasickness pills. I recommend a couple of Stugeron boxes to help to cross the rough seas between the port of departure and Antarctica.\\nMoisturizer. The air in Antarctica will dry your skin.\\nWhat NOT to pack on your trip to Antarctica\\nAlthough a trip to Antarctica sounds incredibly adventurous, it’s not as extreme as you think. You’ll be traveling on a safe and comfortable ship, where everything is prepared for you by a team of experts. Forget all those things that come to mind when you think of outdoor adventures, like flashlights and compasses.\\nYou’ll be able to rent some of the things on this list, especially the bulkier ones like the galoshes, in case the tour organizers don’t provide you with a complimentary pair.\\nFormal wear. Although you’re traveling on a cruise ship, the atmosphere is not the kind you’d expect to find on this type of ship.\\nAvoid heavy winter clothes, like ski suits that are tough to put on and take off, and you can’t easily adapt to the different environments you’ll find.\\n2. What Kind of Ship to Choose?\\nVisit Cuverville Island in Antarctica\\nChoosing the best expedition for you can be challenging. You might feel overwhelmed with so many options and so many price ranges, but there’s no need to panic. I’ll give you some ideas to help you make sense of it all and make an informed decision.\\nCruise Ships\\nWe can say there are two major categories of cruises. Those aboard comfortable ships with cruise-type amenities like onboard swimming pools, great meals, spacious cabins with a balcony, drinks included, a real five-star experience. Those ships are more stable for sailing through rough seas, and they’re usually bigger, although you can have the same amenities on a smaller ship for a higher price.\\nAnd then you have the ones you can refer to as expedition cruises. They’re smaller than a conventional cruise ship, most likely built specifically for this kind of trip to Antarctica, and they have good conditions when it comes to comfort, size, and suitability to travel in the area.\\nThe scientific investigation cruises are also named “expedition cruises” by some people. They’re former scientific investigation ships, most likely from the former Soviet Union, that have been refurbished for this kind of trip. They’re not the most comfortable ships but that probably only makes the experience feel more authentic. They’re also the kind of cruises with the most activities included, like canoeing or diving. They’re typically small, with room for 50 to 100 passengers.\\nFinally, the luxury cruises are the most comfortable ships you can imagine, with steep prices to match. The smaller the ship, the higher the price.\\nRead my page:\\nAntarctica 15-day Cruise Ship Crossing the 66º Circle\\nSize of the Ship\\nKeep in mind that the smaller the ship, the more you’ll enjoy the experiences tailored for tourists. Only 100 passengers are allowed off the ship at once. So, the fewer passengers on board, the more chances you’ll have to take part in all activities and the longer you can stay on land.\\nSize also affects the kind of experience you’ll have aboard. The smaller the ship, the more you’ll bond with your fellow travelers and the more you’ll feel part of a community.\\nOn the other hand, smaller ships will have fewer amenities and be less stable on rough seas. Keep this in mind if you’re prone to seasickness.\\nThe size of the ship will also impact how it sails in shallow waters or areas with more icebergs. The smaller it is, the more flexibility the captain has to maneuver it around obstacles, which is great for passengers.\\nAlso note, that passengers traveling in large ships aren’t allowed on land in Antarctica. If your ship is carrying more than 500 people, your experience of the frozen continent will be exclusively aboard the ship.\\nWhat Type of Room to Choose inside your Cruise Ship\\nRoom inside the Ocean Diamond Cruise Ship\\nOnce you’ve decided the best expedition for you, it’s time to choose the type of room which will influence the final price. Typically, the lower the deck, the cheaper the cabins. The fewer people you want to share a room with, the more you’ll pay. Consider your priorities. If you’re planning to use the room just to sleep and spend most of the day outside, in outdoor activities, sightseeing from the ship, or socializing in the lounge areas, it probably won’t matter how many people you’re sharing the room with and if the room has a view.\\nThe cheapest option is the four-people cabins, on the lower decks, with one little lookout, and a shared bathroom outside the room.\\nPrices will go up from there, according to your budget, up to high luxury on the far end of the scale.\\nIf you’re thinking of scoring a last-minute promotion, it rarely covers the cheaper accommodations. The goal is to spend as little as possible and get something better, and not lower the price of something that’s already dirt cheap.\\n3. Where to Go in Antarctica\\nCanoeing in Antarctica\\nAntarctica is vast and even if you don’t cross the Antarctic Polar Circle you wouldn’t be able to see all the beauty of this part of the planet on a one- or two-week trip.\\nRead about the most visited places in Antarctica and pinpoint the area with the most things you’d like to see.\\nMost cruise ships depart from the southern end of South America to the Antarctica Peninsula, a part of the frozen continent north of the Antarctic Polar Circle. That is a place with a higher concentration of points of interest and where you can visit a lot in a short time. It’s also an area with reasonable weather in the summer.\\nNear the peninsula, both on the mainland and the neighboring islands, must-visit places include Port Lockroy, Deception Island, Neko Harbor, and Half Moon Island, to name a few. In this article, you can read about all the important places that you can visit. After you dig deeper into the different options, make a list of the places you truly want to see and compare it to what the various cruise companies have to offer.\\nYou can even fantasize about traveling to more challenging locations further south and, who knows, even the South Pole. It’s a dream that can come true and there are trips to take you to that magical place, but it will be expensive.\\nIf you dream of something big but not as extreme as visiting the South Pole, it’s possible to travel across the Antarctic Polar Line, but there aren’t many cruises doing it. Those who do it are, of course, expensive.\\nTraveling to the Falkland Islands or South Georgia means a more extended trip but a completely different experience.\\nRead my page:\\nVisit Antarctica – 20 Inspiring Places in the 7th Continent\\n4. Duration of your trip to Antarctica\\nDanco Island in Antarctica\\nObviously, the shorter the expedition, the cheaper it will be. However, I suggest you consider if it’s worth taking a more affordable trip on a seven-day cruise. Even the most affordable option is still an expensive trip of thousands of Euros. Which means it could be a case of “getting what you paid for.” Let’s see, you’ll need two maybe three days to reach Antarctica and the same amount of days to return. If things don’t go as planned, you’ll barely have time to enjoy and explore your destination and, best case scenario, you’ll be in Antarctica for two or three days.\\nOn the other hand, the cost of a longer cruise is astronomical, and you might not have enough time to explore the area either. Perhaps a 10- to 15-day expedition is the most sensible option. That option gives you time to cross the Drake Passage, and even if the weather is not the best you’ll still have plenty of time to visit many places in Antarctica. Money-wise, consider taking a risk and look for a last-minute promotion.\\n5. Time of Year to visit Antarctica\\nThere’s only one best time of the year to visit Antarctica: when it’s summer in the southern hemisphere, from November to March. In another section of this article, I explain the pros and cons of each month.\\n6. Outdoor Activities in Antarctica\\nIf you’re looking to do some outdoor activities when visiting Antarctica, check with the trip organizers what’s included or if you can opt for a custom-made option.\\nRead my page:\\nWhat to Do in Antarctica\\n7. Activities Aboard of Antarctica Cruise Ships\\nCruise organizers typically have a program to keep passengers entertained when sailing or when you can’t go on land.\\nIn addition to what’s expected in a cruise, with quality and quantity depending on the ship and of course what you paid for the trip, they should offer Antarctica related activities such as lectures by scientists and other experts. On my trip, I traveled with the grandson of famous Captain Scott, who lost his life on the first-ever trip to the South Pole, and Jonathan Shackleton, the cousin of one of the most famous explorers of Antarctica.\\nAnother interesting option is to have a specialized photographer with you, whose sole job is to photograph the experience.\\n8. How much it cost to go to Antarctica\\nAddressing the budget as a factor to choose the right expedition to Antarctica is difficult when there are so many last-minute opportunities that drastically lower the prices of the trip.\\nUnder normal circumstances, if you need to book your trip as early as possible, your choices will depend on how much you’re willing to spend.\\n9. Ship and Plane Combination\\nWhether it’s about time or comfort, it’s possible to take a flight for one portion of the trip to Antarctica, usually from Ushuaia or Punta Arenas. You fly into the Shetland Islands, from where you board the ship to Antarctica.\\nYou’ll save four to six days of sailing on the open sea and avoid the distress of crossing the Drake Passage in lousy weather conditions. Sailors think of that ocean trip as the hardest one in the world.\\nOf course, there’s a price to pay for comfort. Check with your expedition organizers about the option and cost of combining a ship trip with flying. Keep in mind that sometimes you can do a mix of both, going one way on a plane but returning by boat.\\n10. Antarctica Health Insurance\\nAll travelers to Antarctica must have mandatory insurance that covers possible rescue on an emergency. You probably think that your travel insurance covers this already, but the problem is that the minimum coverage for Antarctica starts at USD 150,000 and usually that’s too expensive for travel insurances.\\nAlthough the insurance is not usually included on your Antarctica travel package, you can buy it from your tour organizer for an extra USD 30 to 40, whether in their offices or on their official websites.\\nAntarctica Frequently Asked Questions\\nCan I go to the South Pole?\\nTo easily distinguish the geography between the South Pole and the North Pole, is simple: The North Pole is water surrounded by continents, while the South Pole is a continent surrounded by water.\\nBoat trips to Antarctica usually don’t include a visit to the South Pole, which is too far away from the nearest point you can reach by boat. However, you can technically do it, but it’s not an experience that everyone can afford, especially financially speaking.\\nTo be blunt, the extravagance of reaching the point where all 360 meridians meet and where you can travel around the world in one step will cost you around 50,000 Euros. These trips start in South America, for example in Punta Arenas, Chile, and take you to the South Pole in about one week, where you’ll briefly visit the Pole. The rest of the time is spent in a base from where the organizers guide tours to points of interest in Antarctica, while you wait for the right weather conditions to fly to the South Pole.\\nUsually, you return on the same day but if the weather shifts, you might need to stay and spend the night in tents. Flights are four to six hours, each way. If you really wish to spend the night in the South Pole, you can choose an expedition with that option, which will cost you a “little” more.\\nThe base in the South Pole has a small visitor center, created because of tourists’ frustration who went all the way there and couldn’t get inside the base. Visitors aren’t allowed inside the base, but if you’re lucky you might find someone willing to take you on a guided tour.\\nStructures from three different ages make up the base. The first one, known as the Old Pole, was built in 1956 and is made of wood. It was abandoned in 1975, and it’s under a thick layer of snow and ice. Access is forbidden for safety reasons. The Dome was built in the early 1970s and used to have several support buildings. It was dismantled in 2010. Only the third generation of buildings is used and visible, the Elevated Station, that started building in 1999.\\nFortunately, long are the days when explorers risked and lost their lives to reach such a challenging location. On 14 December 1911, the Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole for the first time. A little over one month later, on 17 January 1912, a group of British led by Captain Scott arrived too. Tragically, all these men died just 17 km from their rescue point.\\nThings are easier these days. The visitors arrive by plane, but nothing will save them from the -28 degrees Celsius in the warmest season of the year. If after all this you’re still interested in visiting, check the updated information on the official websites of companies traveling to the South Pole.\\nTerms, prices, and duration of the trip vary often:\\nAntarctic Logistics\\nWhite Desert\\nIce Trek\\nPolar Explorers\\nPolar Quest\\nWhat’s a crossing the circle trip?\\nIf you see a mention to a crossing the circle trip and you don’t know what’s it about, it means that cruise includes a trip to cross the Antarctic Polar Circle, much further south from where most commercial cruises to Antarctica will reach.\\nWhat’s the lowest possible price?\\nThere is never a straight answer to this question — luck matters here as do the exchange rates. And although you can’t always expect that, I’ve seen a last-minute trip on sale for USD 2,200. I paid USD 6,300.\\n\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nAround The World Without Flying\\nEarth is a big place and suggesting one route to travel around the world is nearly impracticable. Each traveler will yearn for different places and experiences. Budget, time, and means of transportation, all these variables will impact the plan.\\nConsidering that planning an itinerary by yourself with only flights is simple, I decided to design an overland trip around the world without flying, going around the world to the west, departing from France. It won’t be too cheap nor too expensive. It won’t be too slow nor too fast. It will be balanced to be compatible with more people.\\nAround The World Without Flying\\nAround The World Without Flying\\nStage 1 – From France to Brazil (Estimate: 20 days)\\nThe goal is to reach South America without flying, so you’ll have to travel on a ship. For that, it’s better to go to Le Havre, in France, from where you’ll officially depart to your trip around the world. Lots of cargo ships leave from this port to all kinds of destinations.\\nCrossing the Atlantic takes about two weeks, and costs about 100 EURO a day. Ideally, you’ll want a ship that drops you off at the Brazilian port of Belém. There you can spend a couple of days resting and exploring after crossing the ocean.\\nTo get inspiration for the next stage, you can stay at Hostel Amazónia, in the historic center, and research the best options on how to get a boat to Manaus. If you want something more private, try getting an apartment at Residencial Adam Lima.\\nDon’t miss out on the Ver-o-Peso market, dare to visit the Soledad cemetery, and try catching a show at Theatro da Paz.\\nStage 2 – Up the Amazon, from Belém to Peru, via Manaus (Estimate: 35 days)\\nBoat Amazon river crossing\\nThe Amazon crossing will be one of the most fascinating sections of your trip around the world without flying. Traveling the Amazon River by boat is done in stages, and involves switching ships a lot. Account for a least a couple of weeks to complete the route and don’t worry about a thing. You’ll sleep on a hammock that you’ll carry with you, the food onboard is included, and you’ll be able to buy whatever you need at one of the many stops along the way. I made the full Amazon boat crossing all the way to Ecuador, and I took me approximately 550 hours of boats during a few months of traveling.\\nIquitos, in Peru, is the most significant urban cluster in the world without road access. You take a break from sailing here. It’s a unique, exotic, and fascinating city. You can visit the floating market in Belén or venture out on an expedition to the Amazon jungle. If you like butterflies don’t miss out on the sanctuary at Pilpintuwasi.\\nFor 4 or 5 Eur you’ll get a bed at a hostel with breakfast included. Check out Green Track Hostel where for a little extra money you can get a private room with air conditioning,  or Pousada Allpahuayo.\\nReaching Lima takes another four days of sailing in the river, towards Pucallpa, where you can finally travel by land (it’s about 20 hours by bus) to the Peruvian capital city.\\nRecharge for a few days in Lima, the first large city you’ll come across after weeks and weeks of traveling. Find a place to stay like the distinctive Gran Hotel a quite affordable hostel, or Hostal Jose Luis at the pleasant Miraflores neighborhood.\\nTour the historic center of Lima, classified as UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nEnjoy the Plaza de Armas, the cathedral, the archbishop palace, the many excellent museums. When you’re done with Lima, it’s time to go on the second ocean crossing that every traveler around the world has to face: the Pacific.\\nStage 3 – Peru to South Korea and Vladivostok (Estimate:  30 days)\\nTo continue our journey around the world without flying, we now need to complete the next stage entirely at sea. Crossing the Pacific will take about 25 days and account for at least 3,000 Eur for this leg of the trip, on a freighter ship. There may be one or two stops along the way, but don’t count on that. It will be almost a month of boredom that you can use to write, edit photos, rest.\\nBy the time you step on land again, you’ll be in a different world. Welcome to the Far East! Korea awaits you. The ship will probably reach Busan but if you find one that docks in Donghae that’s even better, and we’ll see why.\\nYou can stay at the Kimchee Busan Guesthouse, with an excellent location and pleasant atmosphere, where a dorm bed costs under 10 Eur a night. If you want to pamper yourself, check out MS Hotel.\\nEnjoy your trip to South Korea. Explore Busan for a couple of days, there you’ll appreciate it after a month at sea. Visit the Beomeosa and Yonggungsa temples, don’t skip the Gamcheon Cultural Village – known as the Santorini of the East – a place where you won’t put your camera to rest. Get lost in the bustle of the Jagalchi fish market and visit the museums and the United Nations Cemetery, with the graves of the UN military who died during the Korean War.\\nYou have a bunch of quality museums to visit, forests where you can get lost and enjoy nature’s tranquility, clean urban parks to relax. And when you’re ready to leave, catch a train to Donghae or, if you prefer, hop on a night bus.\\nAlthough Donghae is a small city, you can explore it before you leave on another sea trip, for 20 hours to Vladivostok.\\nTreat yourself to a little luxury and stay at the Meridien Hotel Donghae, where you’ll pay about 40 Eur for a room. Then go out and explore, enjoy your final hours in the East.\\nVisit the temples and the Confucian schools in Yongsan and Daongaehyanggyo, the historical village of Yakcheon, the Samhwasa temple. Catch the ferry to Vladivostok the next day.\\nStage 4 – The Trans-Siberian from Vladivostok to Moscow (Estimate: 15 days)\\nVladivostok to Moscow\\nThis is one of the longest train trips in the world. To successfully accomplish your around the world without flying, you have to do it. It’s 9,260 Km covered in six days without stops. But before hopping on the train, it only departures every two days anyway, take some time to explore the city.\\nVladivostok is to many a border city, the last border control station of the vast Russian empire. Land of crude sailors, where winters are rough and vodka flows freely, Vladivostok is an important Russian naval base.\\nThe main square – Ploschad Bortsov Revolutsy – is an excellent place to start wandering. You can go by the harbor, looking at all kinds of ships docked there. Visit the Vladivostok fort, Submarine C-56, and the regional history museum Arsenyev. Take it all in, you’re at a special place, at the connection between the Russian world and the far east.\\nI recommend staying at Optimum Hostel, which has great rates (7 Eur for a dorm bed or, if you want to spend more, 25 Eur for a private room) and is well located near the center and the train station.\\nPlease note that the way you travel on the Trans-Siberian is up to you: you might want to go faster and reach Moscow in six days if you never get off the train. But you might choose to spend the night in some of the cities along the route, which will increase the price (about 600 Eur) but not by a lot.\\nThe first stop happens on the second day of the trip. Most people haven’t heard about Khabarovsk, but it’s a beautiful city with a classic train station and a varied selection of museums that puts them on the list of the best museums east of Moscow: Railroad museum, Geological museum, city museum, regional, military, and art museums. The locals are strong nationalists, which may cause them to tease some foreigners, especially if they’re Asian or African.\\nUlan Ude is the second stop after four days of traveling. A small city to visit and where you’ll find the biggest Lenin head in the world. You may wander around to stretch your legs and add an extra day to your Trans-Siberian trip. Visit the Revolution Square, the historic city center, a handful of museums, and an atmosphere that carries you back to the Soviet era.\\nFurther down the road, you’ll reach Irkutsk on the same day. Here you can visit the magnificent orthodox monasteries of Knyaze-Vladimirsky and Znamensky, the ship-museum Angara, an ice breaker built in the early 20th century, and you can wander around paying attention to whatever you find. Museums, historic houses, the Philharmonic (I suggest you attend a show in the evening).\\nEnjoy the wooden houses, some still in use, that contrast with the soviet-looking concrete blocks.\\nOn the 5th day, the train stops in three cities: Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, and Omsk. The first one, with over one million people, is considered the most beautiful city in Siberia, and an excellent place for outdoor activities. Novosibirsk is the Siberian capital and the third biggest city in Russia, although it “only” has 1.5 million people.\\nThe atmosphere is quite Soviet-style, with lots of monuments to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War (what Russia called the Second World War). If you like trains, there’s a considerable rail museum with over 90 locomotives and cars. If you have the chance, go to a traditional puppet show or the circus. Omsk, despite having a big population, it’s the least interesting of all three, and you’ll only stop here if you have a great interest in Russia.\\nThe train reaches Yekaterinburg the next day. The fourth biggest city in Russia is located near the Ural Mountains that geographically separate Europe from Asia. The 1905 Square is the center of the town. You can visit the Chinese Market and the circus building by going to an extremely important historical site: the Church on the Blood, where Tsar Nicholas II and his family were executed by the revolutionaries on 17 July 1918, thus ending the Russian dynasty of Romanov.\\nAt 7 a.m. of the seventh and final day of your Trans-Siberian trip, you’ll arrive at Nizhni Novgorod. Later, after lunch, you’ll reach Moscow, but if you’re not in a hurry, you can spend some time in this fascinating Russian city.\\nThere’s a Kremlin with a church, an eternal flame, and a monument to the Soviet heroes of the Great Patriotic War. You can visit the house-museum where Gorky lived and Sakharov’s apartment-museum. There’s a decent photography museum and a prison-turned-museum Nizhegorodsky Ostrog. Visit the main square, Minin and Pozharsky, and the 19th-century exhibition grounds.\\nYou’ll finally reach Moscow, the great Russian capital. You can stay here for a few days to recover from constantly moving around and to visit all the city has to offer.\\nRed Square is the main square in the city and a tourist’s most important point of interest. There you can visit Lenin’s mausoleum and Saint Basil’s Cathedral. Then you’ll have to visit the Kremlin and its palace.\\nThe most important museums in Moscow are the Pushkin Museum and the Tretyakov Gallery. If you like to visit historical cemeteries, don’t miss out on the Novodevichy where you’ll find important people like Chekhov, Raisa Gorbachev, and Boris Yeltsin.\\nThe Izmailovo Kremlin is not as famous, but it’s a real hidden gem. If you enjoy traces of the past, visit Bunker 42, an atomic weapon proof bunker that’s now a reminder of the Cold War. Wander the streets of Arbat (the old and the new) and Tverskaya. Some subway stations are a tourist attraction on their own, thanks to their classic décor. If you can only visit one, try Komsomolskaya.\\nIn Moscow, stay at the Clever Hostel, in a relatively central area but very close to the subway network.\\nStage 5 – From Moscow to Paris (Estimate: 20 days)\\nMoscow to Paris\\nAt this point in your trip around the world without flying, you’ll depart towards Western Europe from the Belorussky station. Just like in the previous stage, the traveler can choose to do it faster without ever getting off the train and reaching Paris in one day and a half, or do it slowly and explore the main cities on the route: Minsk, Brest, Warsaw, Berlin, and Strasbourg.\\nPlease note that this train only departs once a week, on Wednesdays, so if you get off to visit something, you’ll have to wait another week to catch the train or combine alternative transportations.\\nThe first stop is Minsk and getting a visa to Belarus can be a problem, although there are rumors that the country plans to be more open to tourism and abolish tourist visas.\\nThe capital of Belarus is a charming city, a sort of massive museum of the Soviet Union, where KGB is still active and where large avenues and communist symbols carry us back to the times of the Cold War. Those avenues were in the process of becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but the construction of modern buildings killed the application.\\nWe have two accommodation suggestions for Minsk:\\nIf you prefer a more central location from where you can explore the old part of the city without using public transportation, stay at Revolucion Hostel;\\nIf you prefer something more comfortable, but from where you’ll have to catch the subway frequently, maybe the Flatcom Hostel is the right choice.\\nIf you chose to visit Belarus, which is an excellent idea, take the domestic train to Brest, a city where you won’t need to stay much time but where you must visit the fortress that resisted a German attack during World War II. There you’ll find magnificent Soviet monuments and a warehouse of military supplies from those days, and more recent times.\\nFrom Brest, travel to Poland where you’ll reach Warsaw, where you can stay for a couple of days while you wait for the next express train Moscow – Paris, or just choose to catch trains that travel more regularly.\\nAlthough Warsaw’s historical center is not that old, it was rebuilt after the destruction during World War II, and it’s a fabulous must-see. Its main square looks like something off a fairy tale, and the streets around it are just delightful. In Warsaw, you can walk for miles and still find something interesting. City palaces, urban parks, fantastic graffiti. There are great museums and cafes. Do the Royal Route partially, to the Royal Palace Square (the full route is over 10 km long).\\nAnd then there’s the more modern part, but still classic, around the tower of the Palace of Culture and Science, a must-see landmark of the Soviet architecture in Warsaw.\\nIf you cross the river and visit Prague (a neighborhood, not the capital of the Czech Republic), you’ll come across an extraordinary environment. Not that long ago, it was dangerous to wander around, and it was a sort of a slum. But today it’s different, and despite still being an impoverished area, it’s been gradually rehabilitated.\\nYou’ll find a lot of accommodation options in Warsaw, but we’d like to suggest the Warsaw Downtown Hostel. Well located, affordable, and with a good range of rooms, it should be perfect for your stay.\\nLet’s depart to Berlin. It’s a relatively short train ride, a little over five hours and a half.\\nEven though Berlin doesn’t hold much of its historical splendor, because of the destruction it went through during World War II, it’s probably the European city with the most cultural events throughout the year.\\nYou have to visit Mitte, a central neighborhood full of cafes and activities, where you can find a lot of museums and cultural venues.\\nYou can stay here at, for example, the Heart of Gold Hostel Berlin, where a dorm bed costs only 14 Eur. For slightly better accommodation, Kurfürst am Kurfürstendamm is a good option.\\nIf you want to stay in Berlin for longer, visit other areas in the city, like the East, which is very alternative and left-wing, where most ethnic minorities live.\\nWe’re reaching the end of this adventure. The train trip from Berlin to Paris is about nine hours. The number of days the traveler plans for the City of Lights (named after it used electricity in the streets for the first time) is up to him, but there’s a lot to visit.\\nStage 6 – From Paris to home (Estimate: 6 Days)\\nParis\\nYou’ll have three decisions to make. If you want to visit the French capital, stay at an affordable hostel, like Young and Happy Hostel & Budget Hotel and explore the city.\\nThe best of Paris: The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Notre Dame Cathedral explore the historic neighborhoods of Montmartre and Montparnasse, but also the picturesque ones like Belleville, where you’ll come across African and Asian minorities. I recommend a visit to the beautiful Père Lachaise cemetery, but the Montmartre cemetery is also gorgeous.\\nWalk along the shores of the Seine River and get carried away by your imagination. Visit the Bastille if you want, although there are no traces of the important fortress that marked the end of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Visit the magnificent museums, especially the famous Louvre.\\nIf, on the other hand, you don’t feel like visiting the city, you can follow the strict plan and go to Le Havre from where your trip around the world started several months ago. In that case, you can share a ride on BlaBla Car.\\nIn France, where public transportation is costly, sharing a ride is a great idea, and after your adventure, it shouldn’t be too hard to hitch a ride with someone who’s willing to listen to the story of someone who just returned from a trip around the world.\\nIf you don’t feel the need to return to Le Havre after your around the world without flying, either catch a low-cost flight in Paris to your home country or take a train.\\nAlso, check my Round The World Trip Ultimate Guide on the specific points:\\nAround the World without Flying\\nAround the World by Train\\nAll-Included Package\\nPlan it Yourself\\nAround the World by Boat\\nTraveling on Cargo Ships\\nGetting a Ride on a Recreational Ship\\nCruise Ships on Replacement Trips\\nTrip Around the World Exclusively by Ship\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Mountain Nomads\\nNomads of Morocco – High Atlas Mountains nomadic life\\nHigh Atlas Mountains Nomads\\nIn a far region of the High Atlas Mountains, land of the Ait Hdiddou tribes, many nomads live in the fertile valleys.\\nSpread out in the vast mountains, thousands of nomads live freely like they did centuries ago. The unchangeable Amazigh (Berber) culture is preserved due to the geographically isolated position where this place is located.\\nMoroccan nomad woman in the Atlas Mountains\\nDaily life is based on survival.\\nWith extreme weather conditions – harsh snowy winters and low temperatures of -4º F / -20º C, and hot summers with temperatures of 86º F / 30º C, this mountain region fertile environment gathers the perfect circumstances for nomads to herd their animals.\\nIn this region the tents are made of camel wool, which easily adapts to different weather conditions:\\nDuring the summer, its thickness protects from the heat and sun. When it rains, the bloated wet wool creates a thick waterproof surface. During snowy months, the woolen fabric also protects against the cold.\\nSo we are talking about year round, multi-weather portable tents.\\nPreparing tea in nomad tent\\nMoroccan people drink a lot of tea. The base for Moroccan tea is green tea, which is served with mint or other local herbs.\\nHigh Atlas Mountains road in Morocco\\nInside the nomad tent, fire is crucial not only to cook but also to heat up and give some light.\\nMoroccan nomad woman in the Atlas Mountains\\nBasic life makes these nomad women develop professional survival skills. They know how to live just with a few daily utensils. Water must always be present from a close water source.\\nSheep from nomads in the Atlas Mountains\\nCattle herding is the main source of income for nomads, as they can sell their animals on a regular weekly basis at Imilchil’s cattle market.\\nSpread in the mountains we can count hundreds of goats and sheep belonging to a single nomad family. Each sheep can be worth from $100 up to $300 dollars.\\nSome nomads own more than 500 sheep.\\nLake Tislit near Imilchil in Morocco\\nLake Tislit is one of the most beautiful places in Morocco. Off the beaten path from the usual touristic routes, this mountain region offers great escapades from Morocco’s biggest cities.\\nGetting there is quite an adventure, since mountain roads are narrow and you’ll have to drive about 7 hours either coming from Marrakesh or Fez.\\nDonkey in the Atlas Mountains\\nDonkeys are the main cargo means of transport in the mountains. These gentle animals are used to help nomads carry their possessions while they migrate to other places.\\nCamels in the Atlas Mountains\\nApart from basic domestic animals such as goats, donkeys and sheep, Atlas Mountains nomads also own camels. There are Moroccan nomad families that possess more than 200 camels.\\nNOTE: The type of camel that exists in Morocco is the Dromedary camel – Camelus dromedarius. A dromedary has one hump, long limbs, and short hair. Dromedaries prevail in the hot deserts of Arabia, India, and North Africa. The other camel, the Bactrian camel – Camelus bactrianus, has two humps, short limbs, and long hair. Bactrian camels prevail in the hot deserts of Central Asia and Mongolia.\\nCamel Market in Imilchil\\nThis is how Imilchil camel market in the High Atlas Mountains looks like. Many people come to this place to buy and sell dromedaries. Each dromedary can be worth from $700 up to $1600 dollars.\\nKasbah architecture in Imilchil village, Morocco\\nImilchil is the highest village in Morocco, at an altitude of 7217 feet / 2200 meters. This village is famous for its Berber Marriage Festival, which takes place once a year, and also for its two amazing lakes:\\nLake Islit and Lake Tislit.\\nImilchil Marriage Festival\\nThe annual Imilchil Marriage Festival is the most important event among the local Berber tribes. Girls from many parts of Morocco come to this place to choose their husband and get married.\\nMarket of Betrothal Festival – the Souk Aamor Agdoud N’Oulmghenni\\nPeople gather in this place, coming from hundreds of miles away. The animal market is also one of the biggest in North and West Africa.\\nThousands of sheep, cows, donkeys, horses, goats and dromedaries are commercialized during the event.\\nCamels in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco\\nAll along the road from Imilchil to Ait Hani crossing Agoudal, hundreds of camels can be seen being fed in the pasture.\\nAlso read:\\nNomads of Morocco – Sahara Desert nomadic life\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nLet’s interview the travel agent and traveler Attila Berenyi and learn about his fascinating journeys. Attila is the author of the adventure project The Travel Scientists. Back in 1994 in Amritsar – India, he was chosen from a massive crowd to be one to carry the holy book of the Sikh back to its resting place inside the Golden Temple.\\nAttila Berenyi\\nFull name Attila Berenyi\\nPlace of birth Debrecen, Hungary\\nYear of birth 1970\\nOccupation Currently, I’m in the hospitality business, managing short term rental places in Budapest. Also, my friend and I have a small adventure travel company so I join one of our exciting road trips whenever I have a chance.\\nHome Budapest, Hungary\\nVisited countries count 62. But honestly, I’m not the counting type (actually I’ve never counted before you asked me). That reminds me I need a second life to get to all the places I want to see!\\nContinent count Most of my travels were on 3 continents, so Americas and Down Under will come later.\\nFavorite way to travel Everything that moves! If I really need to choose just one: that would be a car (2WD or 4WD depending on where I go), that gives me the highest flexibility and independence and that’s one of the most important things when you want to explore especially off the beaten track.\\nFavorite food Meat with meat!\\nFavorite color Ummm… it depends on the color of what, but probably blue.\\nFavorite band Hard to say, hm…. let’s say Supertramp.\\nFavorite fruit Cherry\\nFavorite book Music for Chameleons by Truman Capote.\\nLive to travel or travel to live? In a way, both…. and that’s no coincidence. Nowadays, more of living to travel unfortunately but that will change I hope.\\nFell in love with someone on the road? Yes\\nFluently spoken languages Hungarian and English. My mediocre Russian and un poco español helps me a lot on my trips.\\nFavorite hotel Irente Cliff View Lodge in Lushoto, Tanzania. I don’t really stay in hotels, and if I do I don’t choose by brand. However, an amazing experience recently was the Irente Cliff View Lodge. Breathtaking views. Fantastic place to stay!\\nQuick Top 3\\nWish list\\nUganda\\nArgentina\\nCambodia\\nWill go back to\\nNepal\\nKyrgyzstan\\nAlgeria\\nNever again to\\nThere’s no such country I would never go back.\\nBest food\\nIndia\\nItaly\\nGeorgia\\nBeautiful women\\nUkraine\\nIsrael\\nMali\\nInterview with Attila Berenyi\\nWhat is your relation with traveling? What do you want to find or what are you searching for while visiting other countries?\\nTraveling must be in my DNA. My parents dragged me with them from an early age, wherever they traveled, although back in the 1970s and ’80s in Hungary, we didn’t have endless options being part of the Eastern Bloc. However, that never stopped them, so we discovered the Balkans and most of Eastern Europe, and I’m sure I have been in more museums and churches than any other boys my age.\\nI certainly hated that back then because amusement parks and ice cream parlors were a lot more fun. Still, soon as I grew up, I got more interested and realized that I did have an affection for history and different cultures, so when the time came, I was off to start my own travels.\\nThat’s what I’m looking for: meeting people, talking to them, understanding how they live, how they think, how they cook, what they love or hate, and why.\\nSurely I visit the most famous sights wherever I go, but frankly speaking, that is always secondary to experiencing the “now,” real life. I am positive that traveling, or more precisely understanding-through-traveling, would be the cure for many substantial problems of this planet. I’d make traveling mandatory for all young people if that was my decision.\\nMany travelers are strongly affected by previous journeys, certain people they met, the different cultures they encounter, and special experiences on the road. What is your most memorable trip and why? You can write about more than one trip if you wish.\\nThere’s no trip without discovering something new or something that made a profound impact on us. Every single trip I have done shaped me, changed me a bit, and there are certain events on every trip I will always remember.\\nOne of my first “global” experiences back in 1991 was on a deck of a ship between Haifa, Israel, and Piraeus, Greece, traveling with 25-30 likeminded people feeling that we are the same cast even though we were from all over the world. We were free! A community of travelers, low budget, but open-minded people who don’t also need a common language to understand each other.\\nOne moment I will never forget is from my trip to India in 1994. I was in Amritsar, Punjab, staying in the pilgrims’ house of the Golden Temple, trying to recover after some food poisoning in Pakistan. One evening I was chosen from a massive crowd for an important task: to be one of the people to carry the holy book of the Sikh back to its resting place. I never knew why me, but I felt honored!\\nAnother great experience was back in the late ’90s when I traveled in Syria, hitchhiking from the site of Symeon the Stylite. I was picked up by a local couple, ethnic Armenians. They showed fantastic hospitality, took me to various places, talked about their life, problems, and joy, and I got some insights I could probably never get if I don’t meet them.\\nI recently met a legendary person called the Forest Man of India, in Assam, North-East India. While traveling, we decided to visit his village and see his project. If you read about his story and how he planted a whole forest on his own over the decades and started a completely new ecosystem on a dying land. During a concise conversation, you learn a lot about dedication, focus, and what one man can achieve if he believes in what he’s doing.\\nI could talk about my experiences for days non stop, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion…\\nSome people need to be encouraged to leave home, to lose their fear of traveling. What advice can you give to someone who wants to start traveling but doesn’t know how, when and why?\\nThat is very real, I know a lot of people who are simply scared of traveling. First of all, because fear from the unknown is naturally coded into humans. To go to places they have never been, where they don’t understand the language, where people look different, the food is different, it is all alienating.\\nI’m sure everyone knows someone who travels, who they trust and they can ask if they have doubts. There are excellent online travel forums where no one will laugh at them if they ask even basic questions. Actually, they will get loads of information and encouragement. Let’s start with this travel blog right here, full of valuable information to read!\\nAlso, there are community trips like the ones we do (my friend and I started an adventure travel company back in 2007). Travelers can join a group of people where they still feel independent without mother henning them. They end up traveling the way they like but get basic things taken care of and feel secure by being part of a community.\\nAs an example, I’d probably never had driven a dodgy Soviet car all the way to Mali if I didn’t meet people who did the same, so I said: “OK, let’s go, what can go wrong”? If there is will and desire for traveling, nothing will stop people!\\nHave you lived in a different country for more than six months? If so, where was it, and what were you doing there. Also, tell me what you learned from your experiences abroad.\\nUnfortunately not. Although I always wanted to. Well, family matters… I have lived in Chennai, India, for almost 3 months, and I think that qualifies for 6 months elsewhere.\\nChoosing a favorite landscape can be very difficult. But try to choose a landscape that will remain in your memory forever. What did you feel at that time?\\nJust one? That would be the desert. I really love deserts. Most people think it’s something empty, dull, and monotonous, but it’s quite the opposite. The desert is magnificent, enormous.\\nI was in many deserts around the world, but I had this trip in Northern Niger, deep in the Sahara, where we traveled for days, and even with a GPS, precise waypoints, and some experience with the devices we got lost several times. And that is not really the place you want to get lost. There was the moment it stroke me more than ever… and I realized that despite our super vehicle and all the technology – how small and vulnerable we are.\\nFollow Attila\\nWebsite\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nYoutube\\nDo you want to be interviewed?\\nWant to be included in my traveler’s interview archive?

       " ['Table of Contents\\nAzerbaijan travel guide\\nAzerbaijan was one of the 15 republics that were part of the Soviet Union and that became independent after the collapse of that massive country.\\nWelcome to my Azerbaijan travel guide specially made for your convenience and help you organize your next trip.\\nIt’s one of the States of the Caucasus and has borders with Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Iran, and it can easily be included in a larger itinerary that includes some of those neighboring countries.\\nAs a travel destination, it’s heaven. The capital city, Baku, combines History with contemporary architecture and is especially appealing to those who enjoy urban spaces. Medieval castles and grand palaces are scattered all over the country. Those who grew up during the Cold War will particularly appreciate the traces of the Soviet era. All travelers are greeted with the Azerbaijani hospitality and their curiosity about people traveling from afar.\\nNature is generous here, offering majestic mountains, lakes, beaches, and a diversity of animal species.\\nIn Azerbaijan, different religions coexist in harmony. Most of the people are Muslim, but there are plenty of Christian churches from different periods and Zoroastrian temples. In fact, Azerbaijan is the oldest secular Muslim country, a status the country holds since 1918.\\nAzerbaijan Top 3\\n3\\nBaku\\n4\\nSheki\\n5\\nLahic\\nBest Time to Visit Azerbaijan\\nBest Time to Visit Azerbaijan\\nThe right answer to this depends on what you want to do in the country. If you’re more interested in exploring the cities and getting to know the Azerbaijani culture, plan your trip for the months before the summer or the months after, which means April to June or September and October.\\nHowever, if the purpose of your trip is to hike the high lands, ideally you should travel in the summer when it’s really hot in the inhabited areas.\\nBut each month has its pros and cons. Let’s see them one by one.\\nNovember to February\\nBaku in Azerbaijan\\nTo be blunt, it’s cold. Not unbearably cold, though, because the mountains are like a screen protecting from the continental climate and the sea helps to keep temperatures mild. Expect Baku to be between 3 and 10 degrees Celsius, maybe a bit more in November. There are a few chances of rain but not in a way that it might ruin your trip. It probably rains for five days each month and eventually some snow too.\\nThere are no trips to the mountain at this time of year. Extreme weather conditions sometimes mean the roads have to be blocked.\\nIt’s still an interesting time to visit. Birdwatchers will be thrilled to know the natural parks in November become the home of a high number of migrating species. In December, although most of the population is Muslim, Christmas is celebrated with street markets and festivities that help bear the cold. New Year’s is celebrated too, especially in Baku.\\nFewer travelers come here this time of year, which means accommodation is cheaper and tourist attractions are less crowded.\\nMarch and April\\nWeather shifts from March onward, with the first signs of spring. Snow starts to melt in the mountains and Nature welcomes new life. On the third week of the month, the country celebrates Novruz Bayrami, the Persian New Year, a celebration that was forbidden during the Soviet period.\\nHowever, March is still a cold month, even in Baku, where temperatures average between 4 and 10 degrees Celsius, and it rains for about five days.\\nIt’s a good idea to travel here in time for Novruz Bayrami, for the celebrations and the traditional dishes, and then wait until spring is in full bloom to explore parts of the country that are usually too cold in the winter. The weather changes are notorious, with landscapes turning green and temperatures rising to 20 degrees Celsius in April, on good days.\\nMay and June\\nThis is the most popular time of year to visit Azerbaijan, and the weather shifts faster as time goes by. In May temperatures rarely rise above 22 degrees Celsius, but in June there are days when the temperature is 35 or 40 degrees Celsius. Rain is practically inexistent. There might be some rainfall for a couple of days in May, and then none the next month.\\nThe Day of the Republic is celebrated on 28 May, the day when in 1918 after the First World War the short-lived Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was founded. It was forcefully incorporated in the Soviet Union shortly after.\\nThe best way to enjoy these weather shifts is to arrive by mid-May, visit the capital and other cities in the plains. Then, when the weather starts to warm up, and the summer begins, spend a few days at the beach and head over to the mountains for cooler temperatures and the beautiful landscapes of the Caucasus.\\nJuly and August\\nSummer months are slightly uncomfortable in most of the Azerbaijani cities. Intense heat leads locals to trade Baku for vacation time near the coast, especially at the beaches near the Absheron Peninsula.\\nIf you plan to travel here at that time of year, you can try visiting Baku. If you can’t handle the high temperatures, after all, go to Lake Goygol, Quba, or even follow the lead of the Azerbaijani and travel to the beach resorts.\\nSeptember and October\\nThis is one of the recommended times to visit the country because weather-wise it’s balanced. On average, it rains for six days each month. The mild temperatures and low rainfall are perfect for hiking and other outdoor activities, and to explore the cities in Azerbaijan.\\nIt’s also peak season for tourism, so you should book accommodation in advance and expect to pay a little more than in the shoulder and low seasons.\\nPlease note that fall arrives abruptly. Weather becomes unpleasant, and it could drizzle for days. If possible, avoid traveling in the last weeks of October.\\nVisas to Azerbaijan\\nVisas to Azerbaijan\\nAzerbaijan began granting visas online in January 2017, what local government calls ASAN.\\nThese visas are valid for 30 days, for one single entry in the country, and the citizens of 95 countries can apply for one.\\nThey’re issued within three workdays, sometimes less than that. After you receive your visa in your email, you must print it and show it when entering the country with your passport. The passport must be valid for more than three months counting from the end of the 30 days of the visa.\\nThe e-visa costs USD 23, urgent requests cost USD 50, and the visas are issued within three hours.\\nApplying for an e-visa is simple. Choose the date you think you’ll enter the country. The visa will be issued for 90 days counting from that date. However, this doesn’t mean you can stay in the country for 90 days. It means you can postpone your trip and still use the same e-visa. You can’t stay in the country for more than 15 days and must always leave before the end of the expiry date on your visa.\\nWhen applying for a visa, your passport must be valid for more than six months, and you must send a scanned copy of your passport’s front page. You must also provide an address for where you’re staying in Azerbaijan, at least during the first few nights.\\nThe citizens of a large part of former Soviet Union countries don’t need a visa to enter Azerbaijan and citizens of some other countries can request visa on arrival at international airports.\\nAzerbaijan Online Visas\\nHow to get to Azerbaijan\\nHow to get to Azerbaijan\\nFlying into Azerbaijan is doable, but not simple. Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa operate flights to Azerbaijan, with layovers, that usually cost more than 400 Euros and take 10 hours each way.\\nHowever, you can choose from the many low-cost airlines carriers like Wizzair and fly to Budapest and from the Hungarian capital to Baku for 200 or 300 Euros. Those prices are for trips in the spring.\\nMany people include Azerbaijan as part of an extended trip that includes Georgia and Armenia, and that opens up a different range of possibilities. Wizzair flies to Kutaisi, in Georgia, from more than 20 airports, including some with good connections such as London Luton, Barcelona, Paris, or Warsaw.\\nOnce you are in Georgia, you can depart from Tbilisi on the night train that leaves every day at 8:35 pm and arrives in Baku the next day at 9 in the morning.\\nA ticket for a private car in first class costs 28 Euros per person, a value option if you’re traveling with someone. For a car with four beds in second class, you’ll pay 15 Euros for a ticket.\\nI arrived to Azerbaijan crossing the Caspian Sea, coming from Kazakhstan on my 1-year van life trip across Central Asia and the Middle East.\\nPublic Transportation\\nPublic Transportation in Azerbaijan\\nTraveling in Azerbaijan is easy, especially between cities. There are countless buses, shared taxis, and Marshrutka vans (a common name for this mean of transportation used by all the former Soviet Union countries).\\nYou can also travel by train between cities, which could come in handy for night travels and for saving money and time, instead of staying overnight at a hotel. You can check the schedules and buy your tickets online at the official website of the Azerbaijan railway company https://ticket.ady.az/en\\nTo get around in the city, taxis are the cheapest option and an excellent way to travel to remote places in the outskirts. Remember to always negotiate the fare.\\nHow to Get a SIM Card in Azerbaijan\\nIf you fly into Azerbaijan, try buying a SIM card at the airport. It will probably be a bit more expensive than in the city, but it will be simpler and faster.\\nIf you buy the card in the city, it might take longer. You have to wait your turn, fill a pile of forms, pay at the cashier, fill more forms again. In Baku, I recommend the Azercell store at Fountains Square. You’ll need to take a number and wait your turn, and have your passport with you.\\nAs for how much it will cost, it’s best to see what kind of deals are available at the time. But to give you just an idea, at the airport a card with 10 GB of data and 20 minutes of international calls (local calls are incredibly cheap) will cost you about 25 AZN.\\nIf you buy it in the city, you’ll probably pay less than 20 AZN for more or less the same card. It’s very affordable, and network quality and speed are quite good.\\nA 15-Day Itinerary to Visit Azerbaijan\\nBaku (2 days + 1 to visit Gobustan)\\nBaku downtown and flame towers illuminated at night\\nBaku is the capital of Azerbaijan and the main gateway into the country, not only for those who travel by plane but also for those who arrive by train from Georgia or Turkey.\\nArriving by Plane\\nHeydar Aliyev International Airport\\nIf you’re landing at the modern and lovely Heydar Aliyev International Airport, you can take one of the local taxis to the city center, which is 25 km away. If you do, negotiate the fare.\\nAlthough taxis are metered, it’s unlikely that you’ll leave the airport without negotiating a fixed rate for the service. Taxi drivers will start by asking 50 AZN when the fair price is about 15 AZN. However, if you manage to lower it to 20 AZN, it’s not too bad. The return trip to the airport is usually cheaper, sometimes under 15 AZN.\\nIf you manage to dodge the crowd of taxi drivers looking for customers, you can take the bus, but you need to buy a Baku Card. The card costs 2 AZN and the trip from the airport to the city is about 1.5 AZN.\\nArriving by Train\\nThe central train station in Baku is in the center of the city and is served by the subway station 28 May.\\nThings to See and Do in Baku\\nBaku panoramic view from the Martyrs Lane viewpoint\\nOld City\\nBaku was an obscure small town until oil was found in the region. It became the base of all industries in the country, and offices of the companies trading in oil settled in the city. The Old City is practically the only part of Baku before that time of urban growth.\\nDon’t skip the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and the Maiden Tower.\\nBaku’s historic center is one of the two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country.\\nFlame Towers\\nThe Flame Towers are the most modern buildings in the Caucasus, built between 2007 and 2013. The highest of the three towers is 182 meters tall, and the other two are 160 meters tall. They’re an iconic symbol of the city, and they look better when seen from a distance, especially at night when they light up.\\nCaspian Sea Promenade\\nThe Caspian Sea promenade stretches along 3 km. It’s a clean, modern, and orderly area with vast greenery and a lovely view of the Caspian Sea. It’s also known as Baku Boulevard and connects the two main historical squares in the city, National Flag Square, where a huge flag is hoisted, and Freedom Square, formerly known as Lenin Square and where the Government headquarters are.\\nHeydar Aliyev Center\\nThis modern cultural center is one of Baku’s main attractions. The prestigious English-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid designed this building of curvy, bold lines, worth the visit just to take photos of the outside.\\nThe design is inspired by the handwritten signature of Heydar Aliyev, the first president of independent Azerbaijan and whom the center is named after.\\nTo get inside and visit the exhibitions, attend a show, or go to a conference, look for the entrance on the west corner.\\nBuses 11 and 24 stop near the Center.\\nAzerbaijan Carpet Museum\\nAlbeit smaller, the Carpet Museum’s style is as bold as the Heydar Aliyev Center, designed as a replica of a carpet being unfolded.\\nInside you’ll see an exhibition with the most beautiful carpets produced in Azerbaijan. In a country where tapestry is considered the national art, be ready for a treat.\\nYou can buy a carpet at the museum shop but don’t forget to keep the certificate. Without it, you won’t be able to take the carpet out of the country. If the carpet is over 30 years old, you’ll need to pay an extra fee and get permission from the Ministry of Culture.\\nMaiden Tower\\nNo one knows when this bizarre tower was built, but it was probably between the 7th and the 12th century. It might have been a lighthouse, an observatory for astronomers, a Zoroastrian temple, or simply used for military defense.\\nInside there’s a museum dedicated to the history of the structure, showcasing the history and the myths around it.\\nIt’s open every day from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm and foreigners pay 10 AZN for a ticket.\\nPalace of the Shirvanshahs\\nThis grand palace was the political center of Azerbaijan for a large part of the Middle Ages. Most of the building dates from the 15th century, but it was restored in 2003 with dubious methods. Together with the Maiden Tower and others, it’s classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nFountains Square\\nIt’s Baku’s functional center and one of the locals’ favorite spots, also known as Parapet. The origin of the current name are the multiple fountains placed there during the Soviet period.\\nAround the square, you’ll find some of the best stores in the city, and the commercial energy at the square is constant.\\nThis square is also where the city government hosts events, festivals, and concerts.\\nNational Museum of History of Azerbaijan\\nThe Museum of History is in the center of the city, not too far from Fountains Square. It has an exhibition dedicated to the history and the culture of Azerbaijan, and it’s the largest museum of its kind in the country.\\nIn addition to the over 2,000 pieces on display, the interior of the building is also worthy of attention. It’s a Renaissance-inspired construction, built at the end of the 19th century and beginning of 20th century by one of the first oil tycoons, HZ Tağiyev.\\nThe building was immediately confiscated when Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union and turned into a museum in 1920, that would later become the modern Museum of History.\\nTahir Salov House Museum\\nTahir Salov is perhaps the most prestigious contemporary painter of Azerbaijan. You can visit the exhibition put together at the house he once lived, in the historic center of Baku.\\nIn addition to the paintings of Tahir Salov, the exhibition includes a collection of photos and decorative pieces.\\nIt’s open from Monday to Friday from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm and the ticket costs 2 AZN.\\nDay trip from Baku: Gobustan National Park\\nMud volcanoes in Gobustan.Azerbaijan\\nThe Gobustan National Park is the second place in Azerbaijan that’s been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2007 and that you can visit on a day trip from Baku.\\nIt’s about 50 km south of the capital, and you can go on an organized tour that costs about USD 70 per person. If you think it’s too expensive, you can take public transportation instead. Take bus 195 at bus terminal 20th January to Alat and get off at Gobustan. The entrance to the park is about 3 km, so you can walk there or take a taxi.\\nMud volcanoes in Azerbaijan\\nTwo particularly interesting things are must-sees at the Park: the petroglyphs and the mud volcanoes. There are over 600 rock engravings created between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago, to which the armies of Trajan and Alexander the Great added their own inscriptions.\\nAt the park, you can visit the modern interpretative center museum and see the petroglyphs, but you need to get a taxi to get to the mud volcanoes.\\nLahic (2 Days)\\nLahic in Azerbaijan\\nLahic has the expected atmosphere of and is organized as a mountain town. It stands out for the Persian origin dialect spoken there and its blacksmiths that still work using traditional methods.\\nThe best time to visit is on weekdays when locals are more authentic and open to interact with you considering that local tourists flock to the village on weekends.\\nAt the time of the Silk Road, Lahic’s products were highly praised and were frequently sold in bazaars in Bagdad or Damascus. Surrounded by rugged mountains, the land in the village is not great for agriculture, which stimulated the growth of other industries. Lahic’s carpets and copper work have been famous for centuries.\\nLahic is an excellent place to stay for a couple of days, exploring the streets and hiking, with endless possibilities for outdoor activities.\\nGetting There\\nThere are direct buses from Baku to Lahic, but tickets sell out fast with so many locals traveling there for the weekend.\\nIf you run into this problem, take a bus to Ismaili and from there take a shared taxi or a marshrutka for the rest of the way. Expect a four-hour trip from Baku to Lahic, at best, but it will probably take four or five hours, maybe more depending on what kind of transportation you get in Ismaili.\\nThe scenic trip, especially the last part, takes you to a very different Azerbaijan from the one you left in Baku. It’s mostly rural landscapes, forests, wild horses that run as soon as they hear a car coming, small waterfalls, and distant mountains.\\nTo spend the night, find one of the many short-term rentals available in Lahic (unless they find you first). It will cost between 10 and 15 AZN, with breakfast included.\\nWhat to See and Do in Lahic\\nHüseynov küç\\nWalking through the main street in Lahic is like traveling back in time. With an irregular, imperfect pavement, it’s lined with traditional houses made of stone and wood, some of them with beautiful balconies made of wood as well.\\nAlthough many of the traditional establishments in Hüseynov küç were replaced with modern shops, there are still some gems waiting to be found like the blacksmiths’ workshops.\\nMuseum of Local History\\nThis museum was founded in 1985 and is currently managed by Aliyev Maarif Aghamehedi. The collection with 1,000 pieces is on display in one single room. It includes many photos, tools used to work the copper, and pictures of notable people in the village.\\nThe museum is free entrance and is housed in an old mosque built in 1914, known as the “Aghaoglu mosque,” right next door to the local tourism office.\\nZərnava Bridge\\nLike many other suspended bridges, this structure is very photogenic and always interesting to cross. You can see the creek running fast under the bridge and the mountains around it. It’s 11 km south of Lahic, by the main road.\\nIsmaili\\nTo most travelers, Ismaili is just a pitstop on the way to Lahic. But if you have the time, explore this city of 15,000 people. Not only is this a great place for food enthusiasts, but it’s a city that represents Soviet Azerbaijan very well. You can see and visit a kolkhoz nearby, a collective farm, rare these days, that used to be very popular in the USSR. You can also visit the Museum of Local History at Avenue H. Aliyev.\\nQax (2 days)\\nFrozen waterfall in the mountains of Qax in Azerbaijan\\nQax is in the north of Azerbaijan, near the borders with Russia and Georgia, and has 13,000 people. It’s the town where the Caucasus Mountains begin, and the Kurhumchai River also flows nearby.\\nIt’s a small village that you can explore on foot. It’s a great stop for travelers going to Georgia from Azerbaijan or the other way around. You can spend a couple of days here to rest, feel the pulse of what life is like in the remote mountains, hike, and visit the neighboring villages.\\nGetting There\\nThere are several daily bus connections from Baku to Qax, and the trip takes about six hours. Other vans connect to Ganja and Tbilisi. There are three daily connections to the Georgian capital, and the ticket costs 8 AZN. There are two daily connections for Sheki, and the trip takes about two hours.\\nAlternatively, you can travel by train to Qax, but keep in mind that the station is 20 km from the village and you’ll have to find other transportation to get to the center.\\nWhat to See and Do in Qax\\nIcheri Bazaar\\nThe Icheri Bazaar dates back to the early 18th century. The walls you can see nearby were rebuilt by the Russian soldiers after the Sultanate of Ilisu was annexed in 1803.\\nHistory Museum\\nThis small museum covers the history of the region, from Ancient times to the 20th century, showcasing archaeological and ethnographical artifacts that include weapons, tools, and traditional clothes. Near the museum, there’s a Caucasian Orthodox church and an old cemetery.\\nSt. George Orthodox Church\\nThe church of St. George is related to the Georgian Orthodoxic, and it’s at the main street of the village, halfway between the History Museum and the Bazaar.\\nIlisu\\nIlisu was the capital of a sultanate annexed by the Russians at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1844, there was a failed attempt to oust the Slavic, that ended in battle near the village. After that, the village was destroyed by the Russians who stayed in the area until the fall of the Soviet Union and the independence of Azerbaijan.\\nVans frequently depart from Qax to Ilisu, every hour or so. You’ll cross over the 16th-century bridge on the way to the village. One of Ilisu’s other attractions is the waterfall on the outskirts of the village, about 30-minute walking distance from the nearby parking lot.\\nSaribash\\nSaribash is another mountain village. Peaceful, with welcoming people, and surrounded by peaks almost always covered in snow. It’s a good place to visit if you’re staying in Qax. The road to Saribash that you can only travel by jeep is particularly scenic and adventurous.\\nQum\\nIn this village, a couple of kilometers from Qax, there are several ruins of Albanian 16th-century churches, including the Church of the Mother of God. It’s 36 meters in length and 19 meters in width, and you can still see the remains of three aisles supported by arches.\\nQuba (1 day + 1 for the mountain villages)\\nQuba, Azernaijan – September 22, 2015: Arch at the entrance to the administrative region of Quba. The Republic of Azerbaijan\\nYou can travel the 160 km between Baku and Quba (sometimes spelled as Guba) aboard a van that will cost you 4 AZN. The trip takes about three hours, and I recommend you leave as early as possible because there’s a lot to see in the city. These vans depart from the bus station at the beginning of Heydar Aliyev Avenue. Shared taxis to Quba leave from the Shamahinka and 20th January stations.\\nQuba is a mountain town, famous for its apples and tapestries, and you shouldn’t add it to your Azerbaijan itinerary if you’re traveling in the winter. In the summer, though, it’s quite a popular destination, a common refuge from the hotter days in Baku.\\nThe capital of Fatali Khan was established in the 18th century in the oldest part of the city by the Qudiyalçay River. However, when this political union became part of Russia, the importance of Quba faded.\\nOn the north, across the river, lives a fascinating Jewish community, Qırmızi Qəsəbə, allegedly prosperous and certainly very active, with two beautiful synagogues.\\nThe modern Quba stretches along 3 km to the east, with Flag Square as its central point.\\nThings to See and Do in Quba\\nQuba in Azerbaijan\\nCümə Məscid\\nThis late 18th-century octagonal mosque made of brick is probably the most iconic building in Quba. The oversized metallic dome is laid over the mosque that has a thin minaret built in yellow stone.\\n1918 Genocide Memorial\\nThis complex inaugurated in 2013 is dedicated to the victims of the 1918 massacres by groups of Armenian Bolshevik. At the time, over 160 villages were destroyed, and it’s estimated that almost 17,000 people were slaughtered.\\nThe memorial was built at the place where a mass grave was found in 2007. The bones found there are part of the memorial, where you can also visit an underground museum and a couple of pyramids.\\nGünbəzli Baths\\nThese baths, also known as a hammam, were built in red brick in the 18th century and are shaped in the typical hexagonal format of this sort of facility.\\nThey’re not well preserved, but they’re well framed by the neighboring buildings that are the evidence of Quba’s golden age.\\nMuseum of Regional History\\nThis museum is inside a building that resembles a castle, near Meydan Square. The exhibition focuses on the History of the region of Quba, with jewelry from the Bronze Age, gorgeous Azerbaijani carpets, ceramics, and old weapons.\\nDay trip from Quba: the village mountains\\nAncient high mountain village Xinaliq\\nQuba is a great base to visit the mountain regions, particularly the villages of Buduq, Xinaliq, and Laza.\\nBuduq is 90 km from Quba, and it’s usually inaccessible in the winter. Here they speak a local dialect, as well as in the neighboring villages of Pirüstü and Qab Qazm.\\nLaza is in a mesmerizing valley, with breathtaking views and surrounded by crystal-clear waterfalls. Here people are welcoming, and you’ll be able to see the region’s typical houses. You can’t skip visiting the mosque in the center of the village.\\nXinaliq is one of the highest villages in Europe, and it’s now easier to reach thanks to a newly paved road. Eight-hundred people live here, most all of them in typical stone houses with spacious terraces. The local language is Ketsh, and it’s not spoken anywhere else in the world. The village has a small museum dedicated to local culture.\\nQuba – Baku – Sheki (1 Day)\\nPanorama of winter mountains in Azerbaijan\\nLooking at a map, it seems like it would be easier to travel to Sheki from Quba, but in reality, the mountains get in the way of a route that could definitely be shorter.\\nYou have to go back to Baku and from there travel to Sheki. By road, it’s about 300 km, and you can travel there by taxi, van, or bus. A shared cab costs 15 AZN per person and a seat in a van, for a 6-hour trip, costs 6 AZN.\\nAlternatively, you can spend the rest of the day in Baku and take the night train to Sheki, that departs at 11:20 pm and arrives at 7:10 am the next day. You can use the extra time in Baku to revisit some of the places you enjoyed the most or going to a must-see you didn’t have time to visit before. Train tickets can be purchased online. There are three classes with different prices, from 6 AZN to 19 AZN. All of them have a bed where you can spend the night but, of course, the quality also varies depending on the class.\\nPlease note that the Sheki train station is 17 km from the city center and you’ll have to either take a taxi (that can cost between 5 and 10 AZN depending on your negotiating skills) or walk to the main road (about 200 m from the center) to try to get a seat at a van going into the city.\\nSheki (1 Day + 1 for a day outdoors)\\nSheki Azerbaijan\\nBesides Baku, if you had to choose just one more place to visit in Azerbaijan, that place had to be Sheki.\\nIt’s a mountain city with an incredibly rich past. It was an Albanian state, it was part of the Silk Road, it was continuously occupied by Persians, Romans, Parthians, Arabs, and Mongolians, always swaying between times of sovereignty and times of inclusion in powerful political unions. After the collapse of the Safavid Empire in the 18th century, Sheki was once more independent as a Khanate. The older buildings in the city are from that time because the continuous devastation and invasions stopped any heritage older than that from making it present time.\\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Russia annexed Sheki. From that time until the independence of Azerbaijan, Sheki was under Slavic control.\\nIt’s a compact city, and you can easily walk between the main points of interest. However, if you like to explore a place on a deeper level, local taxis are cheap, and there are several mini-bus lines serving all streets of Sheki.\\nWhat to See and Do in Sheki\\nWhat to See and Do in Sheki\\nJuma Mosque\\nThis is the main mosque in Sheki, built in the mid-18th century, decorated with geometrical patterns and with a minaret 40 meters high. It’s open for visits from 6:00 am to 9:00 pm and a donation is expected at the end.\\nKhansarai Palace (Palace of the Sheki Khans)\\nThis palace, built in 1762 by Khan Hussein as the administration and government center for the Khan of Sheki, is a must-visit for anyone traveling in the city.\\nFrom the courtyard, you have a great view of Sheki, and you can admire the details of the palace’s architecture.\\nIts interior is not very large, but it’s exquisitely decorated, mostly with floral patterns. At the top hall, you can see an elaborate scene depicting the battle of Haci Çələbi against the Persians in 1743.\\nAll tours are guided and last for about 15 minutes. Please note that you can’t photograph inside the palace.\\nCaravansarai\\nThis is the most evident mark of a time when the traders who traveled the Silk Road came to Sheki with their merchandise. The Khans built an inn in Sheki to offer them shelter and a reason to travel there. At the 18th and 19th centuries, it was one of the five accommodations of what is now known as Azerbaijan and the biggest caravanserai in the Caucasus.\\nIt’s still used as an inn and serves meals, although not for caravans and merchants anymore.\\nWinter Palace\\nIt’s the second Khan palace in Sheki, recently restored and opened to the public. The interior is somewhat disappointing, with a lot of empty rooms, but at least in one of them, you can see frescoes depicting the poems of renowned Nizami, a 13th-century author. You can take photos inside and there’s an English-speaking guide who lives next door.\\nWorld War II Memorial\\nIf you haven’t visited many soviet memorials to the Second World War yet, you might enjoy coming here to see the grand style, the clear socialist design, the finest example of an era that ended with the collapse of Soviet Union. Besides the interest in the memorial itself, you can come here for great views of the city.\\nYuxari Baş\\nThe countryside-like atmosphere in this neighborhood of Sheki is so strong you might think you’re at a remote village. In addition to paying attention to this particular environment, take a closer look at the 1880 mosque and its octagonal-shaped minaret.\\nFazil Labyrinth\\nThis is an archaeological site where they found graves dating from the 2nd century to the 7th century. It’s managed by the two archaeologists who dedicated their work and lives to this site. To visit, you have to book with them in advance at the Sheki tourism office. It’s about 25 km southeast of the city and if you don’t have a car, say so when booking the tour and they’ll handle it for you.\\nDay Trip from Sheki: Hiking Trails\\nYou don’t have to go too far to hike. You can start your hiking trip right behind the Khansarai Palace. The vast network of hiking trails is kept by lumbermen and shepherds. The trail goes uphill, and you can hike all the way to the top, 2,050 meters high.\\nBut there are other options. Take a bus from Sheki to Bash Kyungyut (buses leave at 9:00 am and 3:00 pm, but double check the schedule), visit the Albanian church at the village, and then find a car that will take you to Bideiz. Walk the 5 km that separate the two Albanian ruins. It’s a short hike but worth it. After that, you can return to Sheki.\\nCarry your passport when hiking. It’s possible the authorities will ask you for identification.\\nGanja (2 Days + 1 to visit Lake Goygol)\\nTriumph Arch in Ganja\\nIt’s the second largest city in Azerbaijan, 370 km east of Baku, but you don’t have to return to the capital to travel there.\\nTypically, there are buses from Sheki to Ganja that depart at 8:00 am, 8:30 am, and 1:30 pm. However, it’s best to double check the schedules when you’re in town. Be aware that if the bus is full, it might leave ahead of schedule, so it’s best to be there as early as possible. The ticket costs 4 AZN, and the trip takes about two and a half hours.\\nThings to See and Do in Ganja\\nHeydar Aliyev Square\\nThe central square of Ganja is the perfect example of Socialist architecture, where the building of the City Hall stands out. The façade, with massive arches, is a good example of Socialist Classicism. Although the communist symbols were replaced by Azerbaijani ones, if you take a closer look, you can still some marks from the Soviet era.\\nThe statue of Lenin that used to be here during the USSR was replaced by a bronze statue of legendary president Heydar Aliyev. It’s a great starting point for a self-guided walking tour of the city’s most significant places.\\nShah Abbas Mosque\\nThis is the main mosque in the city, also known as Friday Mosque or Juma Mosque.\\nIt was built in 1606, and the minarets were added in 1776. It underwent renovation works in 1910 and 2008. The mosque has red brick walls, lots of stained-glass windows, and a massive dome, and if you have the chance take a look inside.\\nChokak Baths\\nThese baths near the Shah Abbas mosque were turned into a handicrafts store due to the damages to the plumbing system during the Soviet era. The architecture of the complex is quite interesting and worthy of photographing.\\nMausoleum of Javad Khan\\nHere lie the remains of Javad Khan, one of the last Kings of the Khanate of Ganja who ruled from 1786 to 1804. He died in the battlefield while fighting the Russians, so he’s considered a national hero.\\nHis grave had been lost but was found by accident during construction work in the Soviet era. The current mausoleum was built in 2005.\\nGanja State Philharmonic Hall\\nAlthough the grand building of the Philharmonic Hall looks hundreds of years old, it was inaugurated in 2017 by the President of the Republic. The concert hall has the capacity for 1,200 people, and there’s a conference center with 300 seats. Two fountains were built in front of the main façade, which has five statues of the great figures of the Azerbaijani culture:  Uzeyir Hajibeyli, Fikrat Amirov, Gara Garayev, Niyazi, and Arif Malikov.\\nShah Abbas Caravansarai\\nThis former inn for merchants is one of the oldest buildings in the city, built in the 17th century and recently renovated. It’s very central and easy to get to.\\nAlexander Nevsky Church\\nThis church built in 1887 is a testimony of the years of Russian occupation. After the Revolution of 1917, the church was closed as a temple but used for a series of secular duties until the end of the Second World War. In 1946 it was allowed to be used as an Orthodox church.\\nBottle House\\nThis is a very peculiar house. The façade was decorated with 50,000 bottles by artist Ibrahim Jaffarov, and you can also see the photo of his brother Yusuf who never returned home after the Second World War. His disappearance, however, is shrouded in mystery because surprisingly he wrote back to his family in 1957, 12 years after the end of the war. No one heard from him again ever since. The house has an inscription that says Zhdem, which means “we’re waiting for you.”\\nMausoleum of Nizami\\nNizami Ganjavi is the greatest poet in Azerbaijani history, and you can visit his mausoleum in Ganja. It’s a more modern structure made of granite in 1991 to replace a former version built by the Soviets in 1947. The mausoleum of Nizami has, in fact, been many times complemented, redesigned, destroyed, and rebuilt since the 14th century.\\nIn a country where poetry is taken seriously, the place is naturally a popular one. Lovely gardens encircle the mausoleum, and the Museum of Nizami that opened in 2014 is across the street. The complex is in the outskirts of the city, so it’s best to take a taxi to go there.\\nMausoleum of Imamzadeh\\nThis mausoleum is particularly charming and must-visit thanks to its gorgeous architecture. The complex has several mosques, a cemetery, and a caravanserai.\\nThe original mausoleum dates from the 6th century but multiple reconstructions have completely changed its design. The last works happened in the 19th century, and the structures have a somewhat crumbling look that only brings out the charm.\\nHeydar Aliyev Park\\nIt’s the largest park in the Caucasus. It’s, in fact, massive in size and has a replica of the Paris’ Arc de Triomphe and the arches of ancient Rome. It’s the perfect place for people watching, especially on weekends. I recommend to also visit at night when the monuments light up and become even more spectacular.\\nDay Trip from Ganja: Lake Goygol\\nView of the Goygol lake in Azerbaijan\\nLake Goygol is the most famous one of the eight massive lakes in the Ganja region, and its name translates into “Blue Lake.”\\nIt’s at the foot of Mount Murovag and surrounded by mountains. Its beauty is legendary. The lake was formed after an earthquake in 1139 that blocked the natural course of Kürəkçay River.\\nFun fact: the closest town to the lake, Khanlar, was initially called Helenendorf and founded in 1819 by German settlers. The remaining German community disappeared during the Second World War.\\nThe easiest way to reach the lake is by taxi. Expect to pay about 20 Euros to visit the lake, but if you have the budget or are traveling in a group, it’s more advantageous to hire the taxi for the whole day for 80 AZN (41 Euros).\\nEnd of the travel in Azerbaijan\\n17th century memorial mausoleum complex in the Kalahana village, located in the south of Shamakha\\nFrom Ganja, you can return to Baku and catch the flight to your next destination. However, if you’re traveling to Georgia next, you can travel directly to Tbilisi from Ganja.\\nWhat I Didn’t Include\\nFifteen days are never enough to get to know the country. Here’s a list of other places you can visit if you want to plan a different journey. These weren’t included in this itinerary simply because it’s not possible to see them all in a short time.\\nGabala\\nGabala is 240 km northeast of Baku, not too far from Mingechevir.\\nThis ancient city was founded over 2,000 years ago, and it’s the oldest city in Azerbaijan. For 600 years it was the capital of Caucasian Albania.\\nDespite constant invasions and destruction, you can still see the traces of that glorious past in Gabala.\\nModern Gabala is about 15 km from the ancient ruins, and you might want to consider spending the night here, if you have the time, before heading to Sheki.\\nLankaran\\nLankaran is in the southeast of Azerbaijan, near the border with Iran. If you’re traveling to or arriving from Iran, you will most likely stop at this city. It’s a subtropical paradise with a relaxed resort-like environment.\\nLankaran is a combination of rich History with gorgeous beaches. Must-sees include the 18th-century castle in the historic center, the mosque at the Kichik Bazaar, and the mansion of Mirakhmad khan built in 1913.\\nIf you can, visit Khanege about 100 km from Lankaran where you’ll see one of the most beautiful medieval castles, the tomb of Pir Hussein, a mosque, and other historical buildings.\\nMingechevir\\nOn the shore of a vast reservoir, Mingechevir has a wonderful freshwater beach, but the archaeological complex is its main attraction. The oldest traces found there date back to 2,000 BC, but you’ll also see recent structures, up until the 17th century, like necropolises and Christian temples.\\nArchaeologically speaking, the whole area is extremely rich with different identified periods in both shores of Kur River.\\nNabran\\nNabran is on the shore of the Caspian Sea, 200 km north of Baku, and was founded by Russian settlers in 1900. These days it’s a beach town, surrounded by beautiful forests, and a haven to get away during the hot summer months.\\nNakhichevan\\nLocated near the border with Iran, it’s the oldest city of Azerbaijan, founded in the 7th century BC during the Caucasian Albania period. It was the capital of the Seljuk State in the 11th century, and in the following centuries, it was the center of the Ildigizid State. It was annexed in 1828 by Azerbaijan and became part of the Soviet Union.\\nYou can visit several medieval monuments in Nakhichevan such as the 12th-century Mausoleum of Yusuf Bin Kuseyir.\\nShamakhi\\nShamakhi is 120 km west of Baku, en route to Sheki. It has a long history that starts at the beginning of the 5th century BC. It was the capital of the Shirvan Empire from the 4th century to the 16th century, and by the mid-18th century, it was the center of the Shamakhi Khanate.\\nNowadays, it’s known for its wines and carpets, but you’ll still be able to spot those signs from the past: the 11th-century fortress of Gulistan, the mausoleum of Addy-Gyumbez, the Juma Mosque, and several structures in ruins from the 10th to the 17th centuries.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nRio de Janeiro to Ushuaia\\nUshuaia is the southernmost city in the world, located in the far south end of Argentina close to Cape Horn. From then downward you’ll find nothing but water until you reach Antarctica.\\nIt’s not cheap to travel there and most people who decide to visit this region, known as Tierra del Fuego, choose to take a plane from Buenos Aires.\\nI’ll challenge you to do something different: to travel overland not from the capital city of Argentina, but one of the most iconic cities in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro.\\nYou’ll experience many adventures, great moments, times when you want to give up, weariness, fatigue, amazing photographs, and you’ll discover parts of the world you never thought existed.\\nPlanning the Rio de Janeiro to Ushuaia trip\\nCrossing in\\nVisas\\nU.S., Canada and Australian Citizens need a visa to enter Brazil. If have a European Union or Brazilian passport, you won’t need visas for this trip.\\nEuropeans don’t need a visa to travel to Brazil, nor any other country in this route, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina. All you need is a passport valid for six months from the entry date in each of those countries. Brazilians don’t even need a passport to all those countries also.\\nMake your visa online\\nIf U.S. passport make your visa here.\\nif Canadian passport make your visa here.\\nif Australian passport make your visa here.\\nWhen to Go\\nView of Ushuaia Port\\nThe closer you get to Ushuaia, the more extreme the weather gets. In Tierra del Fuego winters are harsh, although temperatures don’t get too low frequently. It feels colder than the actual temperature because of the strong and cold winds. In addition to that, the days are extremely short. You’ll want to travel there in the summer, which in the southern hemisphere is from December to February. To be honest, any time of the year is a great place to visit such an amazing place. It’s just the experiences will be completely different.\\nWhat to Pack\\nTierra del Fuego National Park\\nThe biggest logistical problem, let’s call it that, will be what to wear. By departing from Rio de Janeiro, you’ll be coming from a hot city and you’ll begin to feel the cold around halfway of your trip. And in Patagonia, well, in Patagonia we never know what the weather will be like but it will definitely be colder. If you’re carrying electronic devices, pack them into waterproof bags and pouches. A good pair of hiking boots is mandatory.\\nTravel Insurance\\nGlacier Martial in Ushuaia\\nIf on other trips it’s a good idea to travel with the right travel insurance, when it comes to Patagonia, because of its remoteness, it’s particularly important. In case of an accident or an emergency, the costs to evacuate are very high.\\nRead my page: Travel Insurance.\\nThe Itinerary\\nMap Brazil to southern Argentina\\nStage 1 – From Brazil to Uruguay (8 days)\\nRio de Janeiro\\nYou’ll depart from Rio de Janeiro, that you can explore on the days before the beginning of this adventure in case you don’t know the city yet.\\nFor the first leg of the trip to Ushuaia, you will travel to São Paulo. You can take a regular bus, which will save you time and money for not spending the night at a hotel.\\nThe bus from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo takes about six hours and costs between R$100 / 30 Eur and R$245 / 71 Eur if you’re traveling on a bus with a bed. There are many bus companies doing this route.\\nSão Paulo (2 days)\\nSão Paulo\\nIf you choose to spend one day in São Paulo before continuing your trip south, take a stroll at Avenida Paulista, a street that connects the new and the old parts of the city. It’s São Paulo’s business and cultural center, and where you’ll find more shops.\\nThe historic center doesn’t look like what most people think of a historic center. There aren’t many old buildings and most don’t think it’s pleasant at all. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some truly historical landmarks, like the Teatro Municipal or the Luz train and metro station.\\nYou can plan to stay one more day in São Paulo and visit the neighboring city of Peruíbe, two hours from São Paulo, where you can spend the day at the beach or visit the ruins of what’s considered to have been the first church built in Brazil in the 16th century. You may even stop here on your way to Curitiba.\\nIf you have a limited budget, you can stay at a shared room at Desk Hotel, right in the center of the city about 100 meters from Luz station. If you want slightly better accommodation, I recommend Villa Hostel where you pay a little more but stay in a private room with a private bathroom.\\nCuritiba (3 days)\\nCuritiba\\nThe bus from São Paulo to Curitiba takes six hours and will cost you around R$90.  \\nIt’s one of the largest cities in the south of Brazil, where most people are descendant of Europeans, with blond hair and blue and green eyes. It’s slightly cold even in the summers, especially at night, and with frequent sub-zero temperatures in the winter. When you reach Curitiba, you’ll feel for the first time that you’re traveling further apart from the equator line and closer to the Antarctica region.\\nYou’ll probably arrive at the huge train and bus station, a complex with three terminals that connect to every possible destination.\\nCuritiba has enough points of interest to entertain you for days and you’ll probably have to narrow down your list to just a few.\\nTo get around in the city, use the budget-friendly and efficient bus network. There’s a special bus (R$35 / 10 Eur) that serves the tourist route and goes by 20 of Curitiba’s main attractions.\\nThe multi-cultural celebration in Curitiba is quite amazing:\\nThe Arab Memorial, at Gibran Khalil Gibran square, dedicated to the Middle Eastern cultures and where you’ll find a specialized library;\\nJapan square with a Japanese garden and several buildings in a typical Japanese style;\\nSão Cristóvão, where the Italian community gathers to celebrate Festa da Uva (Grape Festival) or Festa do Vinho (Wine Festival);\\nThe German Park dedicated, of course, to the German traditions;\\nThe Portugal Park that celebrates the ties to Portugal;\\nThe city of Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world (after Chicago in the USA).\\nVisit Rua das 24 Horas (24 Hour Street) where the city never sleeps and where there’s free WiFi for all. And don’t forget to visit the historic center, Largo da Ordem, square Coronel Enéas, and square Garibaldi, with the city’s oldest buildings some of them built at the beginning of the 18th century.\\nYou may also include a trip to the botanical garden and see some of Curitiba’s most remarkable landmarks like Ópera de Arame, Praça Tiradentes (a square in the heart of the historic center), the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, and the Guaíra theater.\\nIf you’d like to extend your stay, take a day trip to Paranaguá, about one hour and a half away by bus. It’s the oldest city in the state of Paraná, and you’ll see why at its small and picturesque historic center.\\nThe most affordable accommodation with some quality is Hostel Vila Curitiba, but if you want a private room and don’t mind paying the extra cost, stay at the CLH Suites Curitiba.\\nPomerode (1 day)\\nEntrance of Pomerode\\nThe reason I include Pomerode in this itinerary is to give you the chance to visit one of the so-called “German cities of Brazil,” founded and inhabited by German immigrants and that keeps a lot of the German culture alive.\\nTo have an idea of how well-preserved the historical origin of Pomerode is (founded in 1863 by Germans from Pomerania), watch this video.\\nIf you can, travel here in mid-January to attend the Pomeranian Festival.\\nIt’s a very small city, almost a village, and you won’t find many accommodation options, particularly during special events. Most people live away from the city center, which isn’t a very compact one, to begin with, so I suggest you spend a bit more money but stay at the most central option: Dein Haus Pousada.\\nThe Bus from Curitiba to Florianópolis will take about 5 hours.\\nFlorianopolis (1 day)\\nFlorianopolis Beach\\nTo avoid reaching Porto Alegre at night, and avoid a transfer and a long trip, stay in Florianopolis for one night and take the opportunity to visit some of the city’s main points of interest.\\nDepending on what you enjoy doing, you can visit the iconic Hercílio Luz bridge (1926), the old city market, the Metropolitan Cathedral (1773), and the Álvaro de Carvalho theater (1875). At the 15 de Novembro square visit the old fig tree, which is over 100 years old. If you enjoy military architecture, you can visit one or more of the four fortresses built to defend the city from Spanish attacks.\\nIf you want to extend your stay or if you have the extra time, you may want to visit a village outside Florianopolis called Santo Antônio de Lisboa, founded by Azoreans and that keeps many of its origin’s traces. In addition to historical must-sees, the town also has a beautiful beach.\\nTo stay in Florianopolis, rent the apartment Centro Ed. Ivo Silveira. It’s well located and budget-friendly.\\nPorto Alegre (1 day)\\nOtavio Rocha viaduct over Borges de Medeiros Avenue in downtown Porto Alegre city\\nIt’s a big, vast city not suitable to explore on foot, so it’s a good idea to resort to a tourist bus. The Tourism Line travels 28 km through 11 neighborhoods in Porto Alegre, does five daily tours, has audio guides, and is affordable (about R$25 / 7,30 Eur on weekdays and a bit more on weekends).\\nFor accommodation, I suggest HostelRock, in the city center, with dorm rooms and private rooms.\\nThe next day you’ll be entering a new country: Uruguay.\\nThe daily bus operated by TTL departs Porto Alegre at 6:45 pm and arrives in Montevideo at 7:15 am. The ticket costs R$240 / 70 Eur, but if you don’t mind paying more (R$369 / 108 Eur) and would prefer to sleep on the bus, there’s another bus leaving at 9:00 pm and arriving at 9:00 am.\\nStage 2 – Uruguay (3 days)\\nMontevideo (2 days)\\nMontevideo\\nPlaza Independencia is the center of Montevideo. To reach there, or one of the suggested accommodations, take a taxi from the bus station (about UYU 150 / 5 Eur), a city bus (UYU 28 / 1 Eur), or just walk. It’s about 3.5 km away.\\nIf you don’t mind sleeping in a dorm room, Caballo Loco Hostel is a great option. It’s not cheap, but the location and the quality are worth it. If you favor privacy, I suggest Chez Mario et Solange, with excellent customer ratings and in the best area of the city.\\nAt Plaza Independencia, you can visit Palacio Salvo, definitely Montevideo’s most famous building and once the tallest one in Latin America. From there you go into the old city through Puerta de la Ciudadela, from where you can walk to visit Palacio Legislativo (the Parliament) and Cementerio Central.\\nIf you feel like visiting some museums, the Museum of National History is scattered into four historical houses in the city and they’re all free entrance.\\nAcross the bay, a bit further from the center, you can visit Fortress General Artigas, known as Fortaleza del Cerro, which is the Montevideo historical center, from where you have amazing views of the city.\\nPocitos, a cosmopolitan neighborhood with a vast beach, is pleasant and safe, and a beautiful place to take a stroll at the Rambla, an always lively promenade by the sea where locals go to often.\\nAfter spending a few days in Montevideo, it’s time to travel to Buenos Aires but you must first stop at Colonia del Sacramento. Not only does this small city has an interesting atmosphere, but it was founded by the Portuguese, something rare in the Spanish-speaking American countries.\\nThere are buses connecting Montevideo to Colonia, departing every hour with Tres Cruces. The trip takes about three hours and costs around UYU345 / 11,60 Eur.\\nColonia del Sacramento (1 day)\\nColonia del Sacramento\\nColonia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is as charming as it is small. It was founded in 1680 by Portuguese Manuel Lobo and you can see the Portuguese influences in the architecture and layout of the city. You can explore Colonia on foot, or rent a bike or a scooter to get around faster.\\nDon’t worry too much about planning for your arrival because the central bus station is close to the city center and the ferry boat station that you’ll use to reach Buenos Aires. It’s a quiet city until the tourists arrive, mainly coming from Buenos Aires. It’s especially critical on weekends, so I advise you to wake up as early as possible to calmly explore the streets of Colonia.\\nDespite being small, there are a lot of accommodation options in Colonia. You can stay, for example, at Celestino Hostel B&B, which has dorms and private rooms.\\nThe next day, if all goes as planned, you’ll be leaving for Buenos Aires. Try not to depart on a Sunday, because it might be hard to get a ticket to the 50 km crossing.\\nThere are three companies offering this service: Buquebus (the most expensive but the fastest), Colonia Express and Seacat. Prices vary a lot and it’s best to check them beforehand online, where you’ll probably find better deals especially if you buy them in advance.\\nStage 3 – From Buenos Aires to Ushuaia (32 days)\\nBuenos Aires (4 days)\\nBuenos Aires\\nThe ferry from Colonia docks at Terminal Madero, right in the center of Buenos Aires with almost direct access to the subway network. If you’re going to stay for a few days in the city, it’s best to try and get a SUBE card, which can be a challenge.\\nThey’re not on sale at stations, some points of sale sell you the card but don’t top it off, while other places top it off but don’t sell the card. To plan your trips in the city after getting the card, you can use the official website.\\nI suggest two areas to stay in Buenos Aires: Palermo Soho or Recoleta. But, assuming you can’t be in two places at once, I recommend the 70 30 Hostel, if you want an affordable option and don’t mind staying in a dorm room, or Hotel Pacífico if you want the privacy of a private room. They’re both in Palermo and easy to reach by subway from the ferry terminal.\\nBuenos Aires is a huge city and it’s normal for a tourist to feel overwhelmed, so I suggest you take a free tour on the first day through Recoleta, for example, or of the Historic Center. These guided tours of about three hours are an excellent introduction to Buenos Aires. They’re free but you’re expected to tip the guide in the end. I suggest you tip around 5 Euros.\\nAlso visit the Boca neighborhood, a part of the city where the tango culture is especially vibrant and where soccer is taken very seriously. It’s the home of the most famous soccer team in Argentina, Boca Juniors, the eternal rival of River Plate, the other big team in the Argentinian capital.\\nIf you want to take a day trip out of the city, I have a great suggestion. Catch bus 57 early in the morning from Plaza Italia to Luján.\\nExplore this lovely city for a while and don’t skip visiting the cathedral. Then take a taxi to Carlos Keen, a small village that grew around a now-closed train station. It looks like time stopped there and it’s a refreshing alternative to the big city. If you can, negotiate with the taxi driver to wait while you explore and then take you to Capilla del Señor, a village about 30 km away.\\nIt’s full of colonial houses and it’s a great way to end the day. From there you can take bus 57 back to Plaza Italia.\\nBuenos Aires – Bahia Blanca – Puerto Madryn (1 day)\\nBahia Blanca\\nYou have a long bus trip ahead out of Buenos Aires to Patagonia, across a vast area without many people and not much to see. If you’re comfortable with long trips, you can do it nonstop for about 18 hours.\\nIf you’d rather take a break, travel to Bahia Blanca, spend the night at Apart Hotel Patagonia Sur (40 Eur).\\nAnd take a bus the next day on the same route to complete your trip to Puerto Madryn, in the Chubut district. Andesmar is one of the companies operating this route.\\nPuerto Madryn and Valdez Peninsula (3 days)\\nValdez Peninsula\\nPuerto Madryn is the base to explore the Valdez Peninsula, an animal sanctuary classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Unfortunately, there aren’t many options to explore the area independently.\\nRenting a car is extremely expensive, about 80 Eur a day with Hertz. It’s better to join a tour that will cost you about 100 Eur plus the admission ticket to the natural park (8 Eur). But it’s worth the money just for a chance to spot sea lions, penguins, seals and other animals, and, if you’re lucky, whales.\\nTo stay, I suggest you get a bed in a dorm in Hi Patagonia. The owner, Gaston, is not only the sweetest guy, but he’ll help you find the best tour to the peninsula. If you want a private room, be prepared to spend some money. In Patagonia accommodation is not very budget-friendly. In that case, Hotel Petit has good ratings.\\nThere are several guides and travel agencies offering those tours, but you can check an example here “Discover Valdes Peninsula Day Tour” or here.\\nIf you look at this area’s map, you’ll notice a place in the peninsula, a tiny village called Puerto Pirámides. Don’t try to find a bus to get there expecting to explore the peninsula from that village. You’ll simply be stuck in the village because the only thing you’ll be able to find there is renting a boat to go whale watching.\\nThe good news: the next leg of the trip is on the Patagonian train that begins in Viedmae and ends in Bariloche. A car with a bed costs about 95 Eur, a regular seat costs half of that.\\nThe bad news: there’s only one train a week, on Mondays, and it’s a night train, which means you won’t be able to appreciate the views of Patagonia from the train. Furthermore, you’ll first need to catch a bus to San Antonio. There are several buses departing every day and the trip takes about four hours.\\nSan Carlos de Bariloche (2 days)\\nSan Carlos de Bariloche\\nAn interesting city in the shore of Lake Nahuel Huapi, from where you can go on one or more hiking trips. There’s a portion of the Huella Andina trail, about 20 km long, that you can walk from here. Contact the Nahuel Huapi National Park for more information.\\nTo get to the next destination, you’ll need to catch a bus to El Hoyo and take a taxi from that village to El Maitén. There’s only one bus trip every day that leaves at 7:00 am, which means you’ll be in El Maitén before lunchtime.\\nEl Maitén (3 days)\\nTrain La Trochita in Patagonia\\nIt’s a small, magical city in an enchanted valley surrounded by unparalleled natural beauty, on the shore of Chubut River. You can stay here and relax for a few days because the plan is to take the train to Esquel and there aren’t trips every day.\\nSo, you’ll have some time to kill in El Maitén.\\nOh! And the train is a steam train! It’s called “La Trochita” and the ticket costs ARS750 / 46 Eur. It’s better to check the Patagonia Express website for updated information on schedules and learn more about this train’s history.\\nWhile you’re here, stay at Hosteria Alejo (41 Eur) and use El Maitén as your base for some trips.\\nThere’s a crystal water stream coming down from Buenos Aires Chico, a small place outside El Maitén. You can hike next to it, through the woods you’ll find there. After walking for two hours, you’ll find a magnificent waterfall. If you continue walking, you’ll reach the top of Cerro Azul, 2,000 meters high and from where you can see amazing views.\\nFor a less demanding hike, climb Cerro de La Cruz, a path marked by a Vía Crucis with 14 stops.\\nAt the village, visit the Railway Museum and the workshops of “La Torchita” where something is always happening.\\nEsquel (2 days)\\nMe in Esquel\\nAfter reaching Esquel, let’s look for accommodation. If you want to save some money stay at the excellent hostel Casa del Pueblo (21 Eur).\\nLa Zeta lagoon is 5 km from Esquel, and further ahead, 10 km away, you’ll reach a small village called Alto Rio Percy from where you can go on hikes in the mountains with local guides.\\nFrom the city, you can walk up to Cerro de La Cruz following a well-marked trail.\\nWhile you’re in Esquel you might want to take a trip to Trevelin, a village about 25 km away founded by Welsh people (Trevelin means “mill village” in Welsh). There you can visit the original mills built by the Welsh settlers, one of them turned into a museum.\\nTake the time to relax because the next leg of the trip will be a hard one. It’s 24 hours on a bus to El Calafate (about 100 Eur). At least the views are quite spectacular.\\nEl Calafate – Perito Moreno Glacier (3 days)\\nPerito Moreno Glacier\\nThere’s not much to see in the city in addition to nature around it. It is Patagonia, indeed. But it’s a mandatory stop not only because you have to go by it to reach El Chalten but because it’s the base to visit the fantastic Perito Moreno glacier.\\nDoing the math, a one-day trip including transportation to the park, admission fee, and other fees will be around 50 Eur and it’s totally worth it. This is one of the most spectacular places not only in Patagonia but in the whole of Argentina.\\nGo to the El Calafate bus terminal early in the morning, at around 7:30 am and check the schedules and which prices are the best. If you plan on taking the boat tour available at the park, choose a late departure that’s usually the cheapest too. The bus trip takes about one hour and a half and it’s a wonderful journey. It drops people off at the parking lot from where it will pick them up to return at a fixed time, usually around 4:00 pm.\\nYou can also ask your hostel or others about organized tours. You might get a good deal.\\nYou’ll tour the park on several high wood crosswalks to see the glacier from all possible angles. You’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the view, so enjoy them and take your time. Don’t forget to pack a meal because there’s only one restaurant and it is, of course, costly.\\nIn El Calafate, you can stay at Bla Guesthouse, where the atmosphere is pleasant and a bed in a dorm with breakfast included costs 15 Eur. If you prefer a private room, try Hosteria Patagonia.\\nEl Chalten (4 days)\\nWelcome to El Chalten village sign with Fitz Roy mountain range in the background\\nThis is one of Tierra del Fuego’s best-kept secrets. It’s an excellent base for several medium difficulty hiking trails, accessible, and with everything a traveler needs to be comfortable.\\nThe only way to reach El Chalten in public transportation is from El Calafate, with several daily buses.\\nTo spend the night, I suggest Condor de Los Andes. It’s well located, breakfast is included, and it has different accommodation options.\\nEl Chalten is great for hiking, Here are some suggestions:\\nLaguna de Los Tres, 5 to 6 hours departing from Hospedaria Pilar and following a path that can be circular.\\nLaguna e Cerro Torre, a fabulous hike of about 6 hours as well.\\nLas Aguilas Mirador is a smaller two-hour hike but with great views of the village and surrounding landscape.\\nLaguna Sucia is an extension of the Laguna de Los Tres hike but don’t do it alone. It’s not particularly dangerous but it’s very rocky and there aren’t many people around, so it’s better if you don’t risk it.\\nTo continue your trip, you must return to El Calafate and catch a bus from there to Puerto Natales. You’ll be visiting a new country too because this wonderful place is in Chile. It’s a relatively short and cheap trip, taking close to 5 hours and costing about 28 Euros.\\nPuerto Natales (3 days)\\nGulf Almirante Montt in Chielan Patagonia\\nSome days of the week you reach Puerto Natales at lunchtime but on most days you’ll reach late, by dinner time. Of course, it’s better to go for the first option.\\nYou can stay at Refugio Hoshken, where you’ll pay 14 Eur for a bed in a dorm room with breakfast included.\\nYou can relax for a while at this town with a vibe of a small fishing village. Visit the port, the city museum, check out what the local travel agencies have to offer.\\nAround Puerto Natales, you have several outdoor activities to choose from, including the Torres del Paine Natural Park where you can see the bizarre rock formations that give the name to the park as well as the Cuernos del Paine.\\nIf you don’t have the time, the energy, or the money to visit the Natural Park, walk up to the top of the Cerro de Dorotea (800 meters high) for an amazing view of the village and the Ultima Esperanza fjord. If you’re lucky, you’ll see one of the condors that live there.\\nFrom Puerto Natales to Punta Arenas is three hours by bus, with several companies operating that route. A ticket won’t cost more than 10 Eur.\\nPunta Arenas (2 days)\\nPunta Arenas\\nA second stop in Chile before returning to Argentina to reach our final destination: Ushuaia.\\nHostel Entre Vientos is a great place to stay, where you can choose between a bed in a dorm room or a private bedroom. The view from the common lounge is breathtaking!\\nYou can feel a bit of the community’s history by visiting the city’s historic cemetery. It’s a town that began and grew because of its port and it’s always interesting to visit that area of Punta Arenas watching the daily routine at the docks.\\nIf you have extra money to spend, visit the tax-free zone of Punta Arena. Take a look at the city theater and the Muñoz Gamero square. The historical Gran Hotel Cabo de Hornos is also worth a visit.\\nIf you have the budget, travel this last leg of your adventure in style by going on a cruise from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia, through the fjords of Tierra del Fuego, near the glaciers, crossing the Strait of Magellan and the Beagle Channel. It’s a five-day trip and the extravagance costs 1700 Eur.\\nIf you want to travel part of the way by water, there’s a local ferry to Puerto Williams (30 hours), from where you’ll have to catch a taxi to Puerto Navarino and cross to Ushuaia, just ahead.\\nThe simplest and cheapest solution is to take a direct bus, that will need to travel a longer route than the one you see on a map because of the characteristics of the land. It’s an 11-hour trip and costs 50 Eur.\\nUshuaia (5 days)\\nUshuaia\\nMaybe Ushuaia is worth more as the result of achieving something, of winning the challenge, then actually being there, at the southernmost city of the world. But it still has to wow the traveler.\\nI suggest the Prison Museum. To reach, the best way is to take the Prisoners Train that carried the prisoners from 1920 to 1947 and was restored for tourism.\\nIf you still have the energy, go on a 10 km hike to Laguna Esmeralda in breathtaking scenery. The Marcial glacier is another must-see, 7 km from the center of Ushuaia. You can take a cable car to reach there, at least for the steepest part of the way.\\nFrom the top, in addition to having an amazing view of the city, you also have a great view of the Beagle Channel. If you’re properly equipped, you can continue from the cable car station for two more hours to a viewpoint further up.\\nBut the city itself shouldn’t be overlooked. It’s great to walk around, seeing life at the port and the old wooden houses, some of them painted in bright colors, which result in great photos.\\nMaybe you’ll find cheaper options when you get there, but it’s better to book accommodation online, especially during high season when prices are not budget-friendly. Hostel Yakush is one of the most affordable options, where a bed in a dorm room costs 25 Eur.\\nIn Ushuaia. Now what?\\nAntarctica Cruise Ship Expedition\\nNow that the adventure of crossing half of South America is over, you might be thinking how do you get out from this wonderful end of the world. There are a few options to consider:\\nFlying to Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas, which will cost you around 240 Eur and return home from there with another flight or a combination of flights.\\nTravel north overland but on a different route, through Chile and then Santiago, traveling home from there or continuing to go up and explore South America.\\nIf you have the budget, you can also take a cruise to Antarctica. It’s about 1,000 km on a boat, each way, all the way to the bottom of the frozen continent of Antarctica. There are tours for all preferences and all budgets, with some of them including stops in the Falkland Islands and South Georgia.\\nGoing back overland, nonstop, to Buenos Aires.\\nCheck my page: Driving in South America – Quito to Ushuaia road trip.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nVisit Ras Musandam\\nMusandam is a peninsula in the north of Oman, a small isolated region surrounded by the Persian Gulf and separated from the rest of the country by a portion of the land of the United Arab Emirates. Its landscape is dry and mountainous, full of impressive fjords, that can be explored on a dhow, a traditional local boat.\\nThe Portuguese occupied Musandam in the 17th century as a part of a strategic plan to control trade in the Persian Gulf and control traffic in the Strait of Hormuz.\\nIn Oman, they still resort to the dhow, a traditional sailboat, for transportation but for fishing and tourism instead of for commercial trade as it was done in the past. It’s quite usual to see these boats along the coast. You’ll find a big fleet on the ports of Sohar, Salalah, Khasab and Muscat, as well as Sur, where the biggest boat manufacturing center is based.\\nVisit Ras Musandam\\nKhasab, the capital city of the region, was founded by the Portuguese. A city they would eventually lose in 1628. Nowadays, Musandam is quite isolated. It struggles for being away from the country’s political center, and it struggles with the weather that makes life there complicated at the hottest time of the year.\\nThe population is scarce, and most communities migrate yearly to the capital city during the hot summer months. For those who want to visit Oman, the Musandam peninsula is quite the attraction. Tourists go for the rugged but charming landscape, boat trips through the fjords, dolphin and whale watching activities, and diving.\\nHitchhiking on a cargo truck in Ras Musandam\\nI entered Ras Musandam hitchhiking on a cargo truck, coming from the United Arab Emirates all the way to Khasab. After spending some time visiting Khasab, I got a ferry-boat to Muscat from where I started my Oman road trip.\\nThe best time to visit Oman is during the winter months (between November and March), as temperatures are much more pleasant. I visited during September and it was pleasant also, although for some people it might still be a bit too hot.\\nThe Musandam Peninsula is quite an attraction for tourists, where you can enjoy a good range of activities in Khasab and boat trips on Telegraph Island, appreciate the incredible landscape, visit the station’s ruins, and dive and swim with dolphins.\\nWhat to visit in Ras Musandam\\nKhasab\\nKhasab port in Ras Musandam\\nKhasab is the capital of Musandam, with a population of about 18,000 people that grows every summer with migrants seeking refuge from the scorching heat in their villages. The Portuguese founded Khasab in the 17th century, and its castle was built at the same time.\\nKhasab Castle\\nKhasab Castle\\nThe Portuguese built the Khasab Castle at the beginning of the 17th century at a place that already had an old fort. At the time, the Persian Gulf trade was controlled by Portugal but, in 1624, the Omanis managed to conquer the castle and ruled ever since.\\nThe Khasab Castle used by the army and as a prison, it currently doubles as a museum. At the museum, you’ll see an exhibition about the History of Musandam and some ethnographic displays, such as the replica of a date warehouse and a summer house. Other collections in the museum include old documents, weapons, jewelry, traditional clothes, and kitchenware.\\nOutside, you’ll see traditional fishing boats from the Kamzar village and old canons with lots of backstories.\\nThe castle was renovated in 1990, and again in 2017, and it opens from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., except on Fridays when it’s only open between 8 and 11 a.m.\\nJebel Harim\\nJebel Harim is also known as the “women mountain”. It is filled with incredible natural landscapes, especially when you reach closer to its peak at 2087 meters high. However, tourists can’t climb all the way to the top. It is occupied by military facilities that control the sea traffic at the Hormuz Strait.\\nFossil enthusiasts will love visiting the mountain, with lots of findings in one of the highest points of the Arabic region.\\nFrom the highest point you can reach by road. Close to an air traffic control radar, you can walk on a path that takes you through several petroglyphs engraved in the rocks.\\nThe name of the mountain comes from the times when women in the area sought shelter in this mountain at the sight of pirates or enemies, while their men were away from home.\\nKumzar\\nKumzar is one of the most remote villages in Oman, with about 1,700 people, on the north side of the country. It was founded nearly 500 years ago, making a first appearance in the maps of the region created by the Portuguese.\\nFishing is the main activity of the population that migrates between Kumzar and Khasab when life at the village becomes almost unbearable in the scorching hot summer months.\\nUnfortunately, foreigners are not allowed to visit Kumzar anymore because of how uncomfortable the locals felt with some of the foreigners’ attitudes. You can still visit the village from a safe distance, with boats getting close 100 meters away so the tourists can see the atmosphere, the architecture, and the heartbeat of that mysterious place. However, this might have changed recently so make sure you have all the updated information about visiting the village.\\nTelegraph Island\\nTelegraph Island\\nTelegraph Island is located on the Musandam Peninsula of Oman. Also known as Jazirat al Maqlab, it is a small rocky island with massive fjords.\\nIn the 19th century, Great Britain and India needed to communicate between them and agreed to interconnect a fixed network system, which led to installing a submarine cable in the Persian Gulf (from Gwadar to Karachi). This same cable led to Telegraph Island, where there is a station. At that time, the mail took at least one month to arrive (between Great Britain and India).\\nThrough the submarine cables, it took from two hours to five days for the message to arrive at the destination, which simplified communication and defense.\\nKor ash-Sham\\nKor ash-Sham is the name of one of the most iconic fjords in the Musandam peninsula. Stretching for 16 km, always surrounded by rocky, bare mountains, with brown tones that bring up the deep dark blue color of the water.\\nBy the shore, you can see small villages, accessible only by sea, with no more than ten families living there and completely dependent on supplies brought by boat. Those are migrant populations who live there in the coldest months of the year and move to Khasab during the scorching hot days of summer.\\nAn incredible number of dolphins travels in these waters, and the tourist going on a full day trip will have high chances of spotting dolphins at least once.\\nTelegraph Island is in this fjord, named after the telegraph station the English installed. You can still see and explore the remains of that station. This small island is a usual stop during the dhow tours, but boats can only get close to shore during high tide.\\nSeebi Island\\nSeebi Island is an excellent place for scuba diving or snorkeling. A visit to the island is typically included in most of the full day tour packages organized by the dhow tours companies and agencies.\\nTours in Musandam\\nKhasab City Guide\\nKHASAB CITY GUIDE\\nFor tourists, Khasab city is a much-needed touch base. There you have all the needed infrastructures, including a modern hospital and an airport. There are also some interesting must-sees.\\nIn addition to the castle, I recommend a trip to the souk (traditional market), visiting the Sultan Qaboos Mosque in the south of the city, finished in 2009, visiting the Al Khmazera Fort and the palm tree fields that supply the city with dates, and the old port. Khasab port has a unique energy, with the many dhows moving around that make up the postcard-perfect image, spiced by the activities of the Iranian smugglers who stock up and unload some cargo here, especially supplies for the United Arab Emirates.\\nMost famous sites\\nKhasab Fort\\nSultan Qaboos Mosque\\nCentral plaza\\nKhasab Castle\\nKhasab Palm Groves\\nPort of Khasab\\nDhow Tours\\nTawi Village (Cave Paintings)\\nFjords of Khasab\\nKhawr Najd Bay\\nKhasab Castle\\nKhasab Castle\\nThe Khasab Fort was a pleasant surprise during the three days I spent in the city of Khasab in the Ras Musandam region, an exclave in the north of Oman, in the Hormuz Strait.\\nThe Khasab Fort is a military building built in 1623 by the Portuguese under the command of Rui Freire de Andrada, General of the sea of Hormuz and the Persian and Arabic coast after they lost the Forte de Nossa Senhora de Ormuz the previous year. That fort was taken by the Omani between 1648 and 1650, thus putting an end to the Portuguese presence in the region.\\nNowadays, the fort is well-preserved and looks almost new. It has several exhibition rooms, including local culture and historical museum with films and objects, contextualized and explained. The admission fee to the fort is 500 Baisas (half a Rial), and it includes a small catalog illustrating the history of the Fort and the Portuguese presence.\\nAlkmazrh Fort\\nAlkmazrh Fort\\nI got a ride from some British who were staying at my hotel, and they took me to a very secluded fort out of the city. If I hadn’t traveled with them, I don’t think I would’ve found it.\\nThe Alkmazrh Fort is an excellent example of resisting the Portuguese and, because it belongs to a specific tribe, it’s still guarded by people from that tribe – a group of very nice young people who offered us a bottle of water and a tour of the fort.\\nBoat tour in the Ras Musandam\\nBoat tour in the Ras Musandam Peninsula\\nBoat tour in the Ras Musandam Peninsula\\nThe Musandam boat excursion was definitely one of my Best Travel Experiences. I loved going on a four-hour trip along the coast of the Ras Musandam Peninsula, inside a traditional Omani boat called Dhow.\\nThere are several companies in Khasab that do these types of boat tours in the Musandam Peninsula, but I booked with the company that partnered with the hotel I was staying at – Khasab Hotel. The trip cost me 15 Rials because I was sharing it with more people. If I had gone alone, it would have cost me 30 Rials.\\nI went on the tour in the morning, which started at around 11 a.m. The hotel minivan took me to the port. The trip included lots of tea, fruit, water, and biscuits.\\nDuring the boat excursion, I had the time to enjoy the unique scenery of the Musandam Peninsula, the crystal-clear waters, lots of dolphins, birds, the fishing villages of Nadifi, Qanah, Maqlab, Sham, and Seebi – places you can only reach by boat.\\nBoat tour in the Ras Musandam Peninsula\\nBoat tour in the Ras Musandam Peninsula\\nFurther along, we stopped near Telegraph Island where I jumped off the boat and swam to the island. Then they handed me some diving goggles and mask to enjoy the fish swimming around such clear waters. I absolutely loved it.\\nOn this trip, I also saw many birds and dolphins that traveled alongside the boat. It was an unforgettable trip to an impressive region with massive desert mountains and rocky fjords. When you visit Musandam, you cannot escape a boat trip such as this.\\nRestaurants\\nRestaurant in Khasab\\nRestaurant in Khasab\\nMy top suggestion of where to eat in Khasab is “Musandam Restaurant” in the city center. The staff is friendly, and the place is always full and looks clean.\\nThere are several restaurant options in Khasab. In the city center near the grand mosque, there are at least five or six restaurants offering vegetable stews, chicken, fried fish, and salads. The average price of a meal is 1 Rial, and it can go up to 2 Rials, depending on what you’re having.\\nAs a vegetarian, I always ate the side dishes but considering that the food at Musandam is Indian-inspired, there were plenty of dishes with chickpeas and lentils, rice, and other stews I couldn’t quite put my finger on. All I know is they were spicy.\\nI had four meals at Musandam Restaurant and paid 1 Rial per meal. I always drank tap water – if you don’t want to pay for bottled water, ask for the water jug.\\nMusandam Restaurant: PO BOX 1 / 811, Ras Musandam, Oman – Phone: 26730569.\\nOther restaurant options in Khasab\\nAccommodation\\nHotel in Khasab\\nHotel in Khasab\\nI stayed at Khasab Hotel for two nights. Back in 2009, there weren’t that many hotels to choose from in the city so to not complicate matters I chose this one. Why this one? Because I tried staying at a hotel for Indian workers but had no luck, no one would rent me a room. It was sweltering so I decided to follow the hotel sign I had seen in the city center.\\nKhasab is located in a beautiful place. The sunrise and sunset are memorable. The Khasab hotel was charming, with high-quality amenities, a pool, and free WiFi. The receptionists were very friendly and thoughtful.\\nAt this hotel in Khasab, you can book jeep tours of Ras Musandam and also tour boats down the Arabian Gulf coast to Telegraph Island on Dhow (traditional boats). I negotiated the price down to 23 Rials per night, considering it was the low tourism season and I checked in on a weekday. The price includes a buffet breakfast, which means you can eat all you want.\\nBook Here\\nFerry boat from Khasab to Muscat\\nTicket of Ferry boat from Khasab to Muscat\\nWhat a great trip from the Musandam Peninsula to Muscat, the capital of Oman. There’s a boat that connects the two cities twice a week. The Musandam Peninsula is a small peninsula in the east of Arabia that is separated from the rest of Oman. Either you travel by boat between Khasab and Muscat, or you have to enter the United Arab Emirates via Ras al Khaimah and reenter Oman.\\nFerry boat from Khasab to Muscat\\nFerry boat from Khasab to Muscat\\nFerry boat from Khasab to Muscat\\nThere’s a boat departing from Khasab to Muscat every Tuesday & Fridays at 12 pm. Tourist class tickets cost 23 Rials, one way, and 44 Rials return ticket. First-class tickets cost 45 Rials, one way, and 85 Rials return ticket.\\nIt’s a lovely trip alongside the Musandam coast with rocky mountains, where you have the opportunity to see the sun setting at sea. It’s really gorgeous. Dinner (I ordered the vegetarian meal) and some drinks are included. Don’t be afraid to order because you can drink whatever you want. The boat has free WiFi, so you can travel while browsing the web.\\nYou have to book and buy your tickets 24 hours before departure.\\nNational Ferries Company official website\\nBorder formalities\\nAl Dhara Check Point\\nComing from the UAE, you will cross the Al Dhara Check Point. When crossing the border from the United Arab Emirates into Oman, you obviously need a valid passport. If you are a citizen of any Schengen area country, Canada, Australia, USA, and Japan, you can easily get your Omani visa at the border, paying 200AED.\\nNOTE: you should not rely on US dollars to cross this border and pay your visa. I was refused entrance because I only had dollars to pay for my visa. Thankfully, a guy at the UAE customs office was friendly enough to make me the cordiality of exchanging me to better currency such as AED.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nGuide to Couchsurfing\\nGuide to Couchsurfing\\nCouchsurfing is an online community of people who like to travel, where members can look for or offer accommodation based on the principles of hospitality.\\nThe absence of financial interest is one of the cornerstones of this community. People let strangers stay in their homes just because they like to help out or enjoy getting to know travelers and hear their stories. Others are looking for friends or a way to change their life’s routine.\\nOn the other hand, travelers get free shelter that can come with many more advantages.\\nWhat is Couchsurfing?\\nWhat is Couchsurfing\\nCouchsurfing is not the first community of its kind. Another project born in Europe and called Hospitality Club, is a little older but lost popularity over time. It still exists today, but it’s obsolete and practically has no members.\\nCouchsurfing is here to stay. It started in 1999 when a North-American developer called Casey Fenton hacked the database in a college in Iceland to email all students asking for a place to stay during his trip. The positive response was so overwhelming that he started Couchsurfing after returning to the United States.\\nHowever, it took another five years for the idea to take shape. The website launched in 2004 but despite a promising start, a series of events led to the almost complete destruction of their database in June 2006. The founder announced the end of his dream, but the platform users rallied and managed to recover the lost data.\\nA huge change happened in 2011. Couchsurfing went from a not for profit to a for-profit company. A lot of the older members left the community at that time, but the project is still around and thriving.\\nSaving Money is not All!\\nYou’ve figured out by now that Couchsurfing allows you to not worry about a significant portion of your budget. No more accommodation expenses. For most veteran Couchsurfers, saving money is appreciated, but that’s not the platform’s main advantage.\\nCouchsurfing’s top selling point is the experience of spending time with locals when traveling. Although there are a few exceptions, people don’t want travelers to crash at their house and treat it like a free hotel. They expect some degree of interaction, that changes from person to person. Don’t be shy. Each member writes a thorough description of what’s expected of you as a guest. If not, you’ll get there by intuition. You can feel what’s expected of you and find out if the host wants to be left alone or is up to showing you around.\\nStaying with locals increases the potential of having unique experiences. Suddenly you’re attending a traditional wedding or eating at a small tavern in a village in the middle of the mountains. Things you wouldn’t have access to if you traveled like everyone else and stayed in hotels.\\nCan You Find it Anywhere in the World?\\nNot really. There are countries where Couchsurfing practically doesn’t exist, for many reasons. In most cases, these are countries with financial struggles where young people can’t afford to move out of their parents’ house and have a place of their own. Some other places, it’s illegal like in Cuba, Iran (although you’ll still find some active members), or Myanmar. In some cases, they simply haven’t heard of Couchsurfing, like in smaller countries without many tourists. Lastly, and this is rarer, it’s connected to local culture. And by rare I mean hospitality is an ancient principle that is common in all cultures around the world.\\nIf you do it right, you’ll have free accommodation in most of Europe (it will be harder in countries like Albania and Montenegro), in North America, in the main cities in Latin America and Asia, and even in Africa. But if you’re planning a trip across South America, don’t expect to find a couch in the small towns you’ll most likely have to spend the night.\\nTouristy cities can also be tricky. In places like Prague, Paris, London, and Rome hosts might get tired of high demand that could mean hundreds of requests every week.\\nIsn’t it Dangerous?\\nIt’s not more dangerous than living in general. Of course in such a big community that spreads all over the world, there are bound to have people with wrong intentions. But the website as a review system where people can tell what they thought about their previous interactions. So, if you’d like to give it a try but aren’t too sure about it, there’s a simple solution: at least in the beginning interact only with certified members who have a solid reputation and a lot of testimonials.\\nThe first contact and the first message will also tell you a lot about the personality of whoever is on the other side. Remember, you don’t have to host someone or stay with someone if your gut feeling tells you otherwise. What you should never do is say yes and back out the last minute unless you have strong reasons to do so, of course.\\nTips to Get Hosted on Couchsurfing\\nPassport with stamps\\nBefore you start, please note that you’re not entitled to be accepted as a guest, nor is it guaranteed. As you become better at this, your chances to succeed will grow. You’ll gain references as you get better at understanding the platform and the rules of the community. For now, here are some tips for success.\\n1. Make Your Request Personal\\nOne of the main reasons why your request will be denied is the lack of a personal touch: your copy/pasted a message and sent it to a large group of potential hosts\\nIf you make your request personal, in a way that the person on the other side feels their talking to a human being instead of feeling they’re on the receiving end of a chain email, you have better odds.\\n2. Read the Profiles Carefully\\nIt’s not only important to read the members’ profiles carefully, but it’s essential. Firstly, to avoid unpleasant surprises. Couchsurfing is a flexible community where you can find a lot of different things and meet a lot of different people. Almost everything is allowed, as long as it’s clearly mentioned in the profile. For example, do you know there’s a well-known Italian member who only takes guests who are willing to fight him at a judo dojo? Now imagine the situation where you request him to host you without reading the conditions…\\nOn the other hand, it’s unnecessary and unpolite to request to stay at someone’s house who can’t or won’t host you for whatever reason. For example, if a member is only available to host you for two nights tops, it doesn’t make sense to request them to stay for four nights.\\nIn addition to this, reading the profiles thoroughly helps you craft that personalized request and you’re halfway there to a positive outcome.\\n3. Complete Your Profile\\nWhen you request to stay at someone’s house, the potential host will check you out. In Couchsurfing, that means reading your profile thoroughly. If you created an account but didn’t bother to work on your profile, talking about yourself, filling all fields in the form, or uploading pictures of you, your house, and your city, then you won’t have much to show. That increases the odds of the host denying your request.\\n4. You Have to Give to Take\\nA lot of the recent members focus on the advantages of traveling while Couchsurfing, but they forget something basic: for people to travel this way, there must be others who offer their place to stay. And although it’s not mandatory, it’s almost a moral obligation that can help you when you’re looking for a place to stay.\\nIf for some reason you can’t offer your couch, explain the reasons why in your profile. Maybe you live with relatives, and they’re not on board with this idea, or you live in a college dorm where you can’t have people over. Whatever the reason, make it clear.\\n5. Don’t be too demanding\\nIf you’re looking for a host in a city with a lot of tourists, understand that the most popular profiles get hundreds of requests. In those cases, I suggest you lower the bar and not be too demanding. Maybe you won’t be able to stay in the city center, or perhaps you have to stay with someone who’s not so knowledgeable about the local community. It’s also likely that you won’t have a room to yourself.\\nHow to Choose the Perfect Host\\nMy Couchsurfing house in Muscat, Oman\\n\\nMy Couchsurfing house in Muscat, Oman\\n1. Location\\nRead the part of the profile that describes the accommodation conditions. Usually, that’s where people write what they can offer, which includes the house location. Location is important. If you’re visiting a city, wasting time on public transportation every day or not having access to them is the last thing you need.\\n2. Experience\\nWhen you’re Couchsurfing for the first time, you’ll rely on your host’s experience providing free accommodation. The feedback from previous couchsurfers should reflect how well your host does this. Read the comments thoroughly to decide if this person is the right host for you and if you’ll get along well.\\n3. Conditions\\nDiversity is one of the main features of Couchsurfing. You’ll find all sorts of different approaches to the Couchsurfing concept in the community, which translate into what conditions they offer their guests. It can range from having a complimentary piece of bread every day to your own private apartment. Read what you can expect from the host carefully. You’ll find this information in the house description and the comments of previous guests.\\nSome people will hand the key to their apartment to the guest and make them feel at home, rest from their trip, and without imposing a curfew or other rules. Others don’t feel comfortable letting a stranger in their home all day and expect them to leave with them every morning and return at the end of the day. Keep all these things in mind.\\n4. Profile\\nAgain, read the profile of your potential host. Try to find someone with the same interests, hobbies, someone like-minded, that you think you could easily get along with. Sometimes, although rarely, all this goes wrong and although you thought you had found the perfect host for you, you simply don’t click, and you don’t have a positive experience. But it’s just a small risk to take.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nGuide to Hitchhiking\\nGuide to Hitchhiking\\nGenerations of young people have been traveling the world for decades thanks to the goodwill of those who own a car. Hitchhiking became popular in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, at the same time the hippie movement grew. Those were different times, before the culture of fearmongering we experience today.\\nHITCHHIKING IN SUDAN\\nBut hitchhiking is still an option. Whether you’re going on a crazy adventure traveling across continents or just traveling Europe for a couple of days. In this article, we’ll see why hitchhiking is still a great way to travel and how we can get the best of it.\\nCountries where I hitchhiked:\\nPortugal\\nMorocco\\nMauritania\\nMali\\nIraq\\nEl Salvador\\nSudan\\nPoland\\nD.R. of the Congo\\nAlbania\\nBrasil\\nFrench Guyana\\nIndia\\nIran\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\nOman\\nSwitzerland\\nRomania\\nSouth Sudan\\nUganda\\nAdvantages of Hitchhiking\\nAdvantages of Hitchhiking\\n1. Saving Money\\nSaving money is the main advantage. That’s what appealed to the first modern travelers who hitchhiked, although in some parts of the world this activity is deeply embedded in the local culture.\\n2. Meeting People\\nHitchhiking not only allows you to cover long and short distances for free, but it’s an exciting way to have meaningful experiences as any seasoned hitchhiker will vouch for. You’ll get to meet nice and not so nice people. You’ll hear stories and share feelings. There’ll be ups and downs. In short, you will live intensely.\\n3. Adventure Travel\\nWhen you’re hitchhiking your way through the world, you’ll never know how your day will end. Or your week. You might have planned to travel to Turkey, but suddenly you find yourself on the way to Finland. Just because you hopped on a truck driven by someone who fascinated you, who kept telling stories about their job, who said wonderful things about other stuff, who offered you a place to stay somewhere that has nothing to do with Turkey.\\nTips for Successful Hitchhiking\\nTips for Successful Hitchhiking\\n1. Pick a Good Spot\\nThe spot where you hitchhike is essential and could mean the difference between waiting for hours or hitting the road within minutes.\\nAvoid places with a lot of local traffic, usually around highly populated areas where people commute to work. What you need as a traveler is the kind of traffic that’s clearly traveling long distance, and for that, you have to get out of the city. Look for points of access to larger roads or highways that don’t stop in too many towns between larger cities.\\n2. Pick a Busy Route\\nWhen you look in a map, the logical route between city A and city B, or your point of departure and your point of arrival, seems to be the road that shortens the distance. However, it’s best if you pick a busier route even if the gap is more significant. Remember that hitchhiking is all about the odds: the more cars driving by, the higher the chances to succeed. It’s better to take a bigger detour and come across many opportunities for hitchhiking, then the other way around.\\n3. Look for Gas Stations\\nIf you’re social and feel like your personality is a powerful weapon, look for busy gas stations and talk to the people who stop there. That way, you can observe people and choose the ones that feel more trustworthy. Those usually are the people with the more potential to give you a ride: service vans, cars that look like they belong to travelers, trucks. Please note that some service vans are not allowed to pick up passengers, a restriction given by their employers or their insurance company.\\nOn the other hand, if you’re crossing a border, remember that trucks are sometimes forced to wait for longer before entering a country. Account for that too.\\nIn countries without significant law constraints, look for pickup trucks and ask to ride in the back. It will be easier to get a yes.\\n4. Give Space\\nIt’s important that you choose a spot that gives enough space to the drivers approaching you. It’s not just a matter of road safety, but it’s to give them time to look at you, judge the situation and decide if they want to stop or not. If you don’t give drivers space, your odds for success will decrease.\\n5. Looks and Body Language\\nForget what you know about yourself: that you’re a wonderful person, honest, trustworthy and all that. The important thing is that the driver approaching you has to decide what they think of you in a split second. And to let them know you’re okay, there are only two things that matter: how you look and your attitude.\\nSo put on your best clothes, try to look clean and pay attention to all the details that could undermine the trust of a stranger.\\nTry to wear light clothes, they not only increase your chances of being seen, but they convey trust. Let go of those colorful, stylish pants or that black t-shirt with questionable slogans.\\nSome people believe you should clearly show you’re a traveler and not someone looking for adventure on the side of the road, so make sure you keep your backpack front and center.\\nYour body language and facial expressions are also important. Drivers will see them too and judge you based on that, in seconds. If you’re oozing positive vibes, the drivers will pick up on that. Smile and look straight into the eyes of the driver.\\nThere’s at least one study that shows how eye contact improves the odds of hitchhiking. Don’t wear sunglasses and if you’re wearing a hat make sure it doesn’t cover your face. Mind the details: if drivers can see your hands, they’ll tend to trust you more.\\nSafety Tips while hitchhiking\\nSafety Tips while hitchhiking\\nA lot of people, especially women, are afraid to hitchhike and being out alone. It can be frightening to hop inside a car or a truck with one or more strange men, in a foreign country with culture and habits that are unknown to us. But let’s take things slow and not be extreme. There’s a series of rules that you can follow to reduce the risks.\\n1. Only During the Day!\\nThis is a key rule and not just for safety reasons. The night isn’t good for hitchhiking, for many reasons. Not only do we have trouble seeing who’s inside the vehicle, but the drivers have a hard time seeing us, and they tend to be more careful after sundown. Fewer cars on the road, extra careful drivers, weirder people behind the wheel, probably driving under the influence. It’s just not worth the trouble. After sunset, it’s best to call it a day and spend the night wherever you are.\\nWhat if you hitchhiked during the day and now it’s night time? Most of the previous concerns don’t apply, but you should be extra careful: pay attention to the driver’s route, avoid hopping off in areas that look sketchy, especially in large industrial areas in big cities. You don’t want to jump out of the frying pan into the fire.\\n2. Protection Tools\\nA lot of travelers consider carrying a weapon. Not necessarily a gun, of course, but they usually think about bringing a knife. Psychologically, it gives you a sense of comfort and safety, but I advise you not to do it. Picture that you’re carrying a knife and you misjudge a situation, you then show the knife in haste, and the situation escalates into something worse. Maybe a better solution would’ve been to resist or use strong words, but from the moment you show a weapon you’re opening a door you might not be able to close: a door to extreme violence.\\nOpt for traveling with a small can of pepper spray, a self-defense tool that’s not illegal in all countries. Whatever your choice, research the law of the country you’re visiting before you travel.\\n3. Research the Country\\nBefore hitchhiking in a new country, research its quirks. In some cases, it might be illegal to hitchhike. Gather information about the acceptance rate of this activity and how safe it is. Also, keep in mind that it’s common to pay to hitchhike in several countries.\\n4. Laying Low\\nAnything that helps to not draw the attention of potentially dangerous people to yourself is a good idea. Don’t carry valuable items where people can see them and try not to attract the wrong kind of attention.\\n5. Don’t Travel Alone\\nIf you’re not one hundred percent comfortable to hitchhike on your own, find a travel partner. It’s more complicated for some ill-intentioned person to go after two people (but it also may be harder to hitch a ride).\\n6. Common Sense\\nCommon sense is highly subjective, but I think we can all agree it’s not wise to drink heavily inside the confined space of a car with people we don’t know.\\nDon’t hesitate to refuse a ride if you feel that the car occupants aren’t trustworthy. For that same reason, don’t use one of those signs with your destination written on it. Sending a text message with the plate numbers to someone you trust is also a good idea.\\nIf you stop in the middle of the ride for gas or a meal, for example, keep your backpack with you at all times. If that’s not possible, at least keep an eye on the car and carry your valuable items with you.\\nIt’s best not to fall asleep in a car with strangers, especially if you’re not 100% sure about them being respectful.\\n7. Road Safety\\nAlthough most of the hitchhiker’s fears are about the risks of people who don’t mean well, remember that roads and vehicles are potentially dangerous and that accidents happen frequently. Make sure you take all precautions possible. Try to walk facing the traffic direction and not with your back turned to it. Choose your hitchhiking spots wisely, considering visibility and needed space for cars to stop.\\nInside the car, always wear a seatbelt and observe how your ride drives. If you don’t feel good about it, consider the if it’s best to look for another ride.\\nCarpooling\\nCarpooling\\nSome websites connect hitchhikers with lonely drivers who are looking for a road partner, like MyLifts and EuroLift.\\nYou can also pay for this service, although it won’t be as cheap as a traditional hitchhike. However, you’ll still save money compared to what you’d spend on public transportation, especially in countries where it’s expensive like France or Italy. In the paid service, drivers take passengers who are willing to split the gas costs. The most popular website is Blablacar, available in many countries.  \\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nBest Travel Photography Gear\\nPeople who are starting to travel or to photograph ask the same question a lot. What’s the right camera?\\nIt’s a complicated question to answer. Each person is unique, with their own set of preferences and criteria that it’s virtually impossible to say this or that camera is the best for travel photography.\\nWhat is the best travel camera?\\nBudget is one of the first things to have in mind. How much do you want to spend to start travel photography?\\nIn general, there are four budget ranges:\\nUp to 250 Euros. It’s an amount that allows you to buy a smartphone with a reasonable quality camera. Keep in mind that it should be your idea of “reasonable,” not anyone else’s. Before you decide, test it, research online, read gear reviews. You can buy a mid-range compact camera (or low-range if you really don’t want to spend that much) and maybe a low-range bridge or mirrorless camera.\\nFrom 250 to 400 Euros. Is where you’ll find the most popular options: low-range SLRs, reasonable compact cameras, good quality smartphones, and satisfactory Bridge and Mirrorless cameras. You have hundreds of options in this range, so good luck with researching and choosing.\\nFrom 400 to 800 Euros. At this range, forget about compacts. If you consider a smartphone that costs this much, think if you’re willing to take the risk of losing it or accidentally damaging it. Most people at this budget range choose a semi-professional SLR or a great Bridge or Mirrorless camera.\\nOver 800 Euros. Honestly, there aren’t that many travelers willing to parade around with gear this expensive, that is very close to professional standards. This budget allows you to buy excellent SLRs but to upgrade them with the same-level accessories and lenses you’ll have to invest a lot of money. You can buy a mirrorless that will leave a lot of people jealous. Or use the funds for SLR accessories like a tripod, additional lenses, batteries, etc.\\nAfter the budget, consider your inclination to carry all the gear. Many people go into a store, falls for the sales pitch, and comes out with an SLR full of technical possibilities. Then they go on the first trip and pack the camera, but it’s too big and heavy, so it ends up staying at the hotel most of the time, and when they return home they realize they took most of the photos with… their smartphone. Don’t fall for this. You’ll feel bad about it and will end up selling the camera, losing money in the process.\\nLastly, consider how much into photography you really are. Is it a temporary hobby? Do you have the time and energy to learn a bit more about this art and the techniques and principles around it? These are essential questions to ask yourself because just like judging the weight and volume of a camera, being too optimistic about your availability will make you lose money unnecessarily.\\nPhoto camera comparison\\n1. SLRs\\nThe acronym SLR stands for Single Lens Reflex, and it’s sometimes called just “reflex cameras.” And why reflex? Because these cameras use a little mirror to show the user what the lens is capturing from the outside world and, therefore, what the camera sensor will “see” at the time of the shot. These are the traditional cameras professionals use, they look robust and bulky, and you can change the lens according to your needs at the time, so they’re pretty versatile cameras.\\nMain Advantages of SLR Cameras:\\nPossibility to use different lenses that will open endless possibilities to the photographer. From fisheye lenses to wide angle focal distances and superzoom… An SLR can be upgraded with an infinite range of lenses, and the end quality of the photos depends on what the photographer wants to buy or can buy. The difference between a picture taken with a high-quality lens and a photo taken with a low-range one is gigantic. Many people think that buying an expensive camera will allow them to take high-quality images, but that’s an illusion. It’s all about the lens.\\nReduced battery consumption which, of course, varies according to different brands and models. But it typically has more battery autonomy than other kinds of cameras. It’s not absurd to think you can take about 1200 photographs with only one battery. The main reason for such a durable battery is not having an LCD that’s always on.\\nErgonomy. Although smaller cameras are enticing and easy and light to carry around, the truth is that hands will never become as small as technology. For most people, an SLR is the best concerning stability and comfort to use.\\nQuickly ready to shoot. It’s true that this has been improved in other cameras over time, but how fast you can use an SLR will still be better for a long time. You notice that from the moment you turn on the camera. An SLR is ready to work in a split second, while most other cameras take a while to be ready after turning them on. Next is the automatic focus speed that is also faster in an SLR.\\nMain Disadvantages of SLR Cameras:\\nThey’re bulky and heavy when compared to other cameras which don’t make them appealing for travelers who need to manage luggage space and weight.\\nSimplified software. If you like to explore menus, settings, and endless possibilities, SLRs can be disappointing. When it comes to technological fantasies, they’re not that gifted. Panoramic photography and other software-based options, for example, are more common in compact and mirrorless cameras than in SLRs.\\nPrice can be a disadvantage but not necessarily. It’s true that a compact camera costs less than an SLR, but it’s also true that a low-range SLR is quite affordable, costing even less than most compacts and mirrorless. But, of course, it will be a low-range SLR.\\nNoise. The shooting noise can be inconvenient when you’re trying to photograph a silent place, like a church or a museum, a music concert, or when you’re trying to shoot people or animals discreetly.\\nSensor dust. When we change lenses, the sensor is exposed to dust particles in the air, and they frequently stick to the surface. In most photos, only the abnormally large particles are visible, but when you need to use tiny lens apertures, all those particles show up in the picture, which means you’ll have to remove them with software. The cameras come with a self-cleaning system, but it’s quite limited.\\n2. Compact Cameras\\nCompact cameras are the oldest in the market. They’re the real veterans, the first alternative to the largely sold classic SLRs, even before the digital age. These days, they depend a lot on the quality of the software, and the physical and mechanical aspects are often overlooked. As you can tell by their name, they’re small and light cameras, ideal for traveling, in theory. As with everything else, there are some inconveniences.\\nPlease note that mirrorless cameras are technically compact and when I talk about compact cameras, I mean mirrorless. Meaning, they don’t have a mirror that reflects what the lens is “seeing” into the sensor. However, it’s now common to call mirrorless cameras to the more upgraded and less compact models, including some that slide into the market of changeable lenses that used to be SLR exclusive.\\nMain Advantages of Compact Cameras:\\nBeing light and small is the most significant advantage of compact cameras. It’s the natural choice for travelers. By definition, they can easily fit in a pocket.\\nPrice. Some cost small fortunes with jaw-dropping results. But, realistically, they’re the most affordable camera range. You can buy a compact camera for under 50 Euros.\\nSoftware functionalities like getting a panoramic photograph from a sequence of images or the HDR (High Dynamic Range) effect are very interesting features in these cameras\\nDurable models are available at interesting price ranges. Although the ordinary compact cameras are fragile, there are models available in the market that are prepared for outdoor activities, with rubber casing to resist impact and rain proof. There are also models for under 200 Euros that you can take for a swim in the ocean or the pool, providing great underwater photographs.\\nSimplicity. Okay, the extreme simplicity in working these cameras can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. It all boils down to your photography skills or your willingness to improve them. If you want to keep things practical and simple, you wouldn’t probably be reading this article, but if that is still the case, the simplicity of compacts is a bonus for you.\\nMain Disadvantages of Compact Cameras:\\nPoor ergonomics: It’s the perfect size to carry when traveling, but the human hands don’t adjust well to the reduced size of compact cameras.\\nPoor robustness. These were cameras that weren’t built to handle significant impacts. Even the smallest contact or rain can easily ruin one of these cameras. There are exceptions of course.\\nYou easily lose them. They’re so small that they’re quickly forgotten in a dark corner, a hotel bed, a plane or a train, at a restaurant table.\\nNo viewfinder. For old school photographers, shooting through an LCD instead of the viewfinder can be a problem. And not many compact cameras have it.\\nPoor flexibility in controlling the traditional functions of photography. Low-range models offer no control over the photo, and that’s why they call them point and shoot cameras.\\nLower image quality, although some of the top-range models produce surprising results. You can’t work around some elements, though, and the small size is the enemy of quality in this matter.\\n3. Mirrorless Cameras\\nThis is a relatively recent range of cameras. They combine features of SLR and compact cameras. In theory, they should give the best of both worlds, but not all is wonderful about this concept. Nevertheless, they’re either the top choice of most travel photographers, or they’ll soon become one.\\nThey are called mirrorless because they don’t have an optical system, like the SLRs, where there’s a mirror that projects into to the viewfinder what the lens transmits and, when you click to shoot, the mirror rotates to send the same image into the viewfinder. That’s why when you’re taking a photo with an SLR, you can’t see anything through the viewfinder in the split second the image is being captured.\\nIn a mirrorless camera, what the lens “sees” goes straight into the sensor. If the camera has an apparent traditional viewfinder, what you see there is generated electronically (and that’s why you can’t see anything when the camera is off, or you see a strange shadow).\\nMain Advantages of Mirrorless Cameras:\\nAttractive design generally based in vintage, revival models that reminisce of what was probably photography’s golden age, around the 1970s.\\nExcellent quality-size ratio, considering mirrorless don’t need the prism and mirror as the SLRs.\\nWhat you see before shooting is already a prediction of what you’ll capture\\nBest sequence shooting speed, which is essential for photographing very active scenes or wildlife\\nThey are relatively inconspicuous, an important feature for when you’re shooting sensitive locations or people when\\nUsually, it’s possible to use an adaptor to use other models’ lenses\\nThe problem of dust particles in the sensor is not as troubling in mirrorless cameras as it is in SLRs\\nGood quality/price ration and a big range of models to choose\\nMain Disadvantages of Mirrorless Cameras:\\nEnergy management. Mirrorless cameras consume a lot of battery. A standard model uses up one full charge after 300 photos. You get four times more with an SLR. Of course, you can carry extra batteries, but logistics becomes cumbersome and come with a price.\\nResponse time when turning the camera on or when using autofocus and other essential features. Although these issues are less frequent in more recent models and they’ll probably end soon.\\nJust like in the SLRs, changing the lens will cause dust particles to settle on the sensor and show up in some of the pictures\\nSeeing a preview of the photograph instead of what it will really look like can also be a disadvantage. In situations when you don’t have the best light, that preview is slow and dark.\\nErgonomics. Most models are too small to be used properly\\n4. Bridge Cameras\\nThe concept behind these cameras is somewhat obsolete. It was over a decade ago that some manufacturers invested in this idea of a camera that was supposed to be a bridge (hence the name) between compacts and SLRs.\\nSome people say the name comes from the connection between photographing with film and digital pictures. Whatever the reason, when these cameras came up, in the early 21st century, the amateur photography world was reduced to two great options: compact cameras or the heavy and bulky SLRs.\\nBridge cameras, in which Sony invested a lot, offered a quality level close to some of the SLRs and without the disadvantages, I’ve already mentioned.\\nThey were cheaper, lighter, and slightly smaller. On the other hand, you can’t switch lenses on a Bridge camera, although they come standard with a pretty versatile one.\\nThe golden age for these cameras is around the year 2004, but the concept has survived and made it to our days.\\nMain Advantages of Bridge Cameras:\\nThe balance between the advantages and disadvantages of compact cameras and SLRs.\\nVersatility. You can’t change the lenses but the ones that come with the camera cover most of the basic needs of a travel photographer\\nThe same flexibility in controlling all of the picture parameters that you’ll get in an SLR.\\nWithout lenses to change, you can keep the camera sensor clean and dust particle free\\nThey’re the best one-piece cameras (without separate lenses) you can buy\\nIn theory, they’re the right fit for the traveler who enjoys photographing\\nMain Disadvantages of Bridge Cameras:\\nYou can’t change the lenses which limit the potential of more demanding photographers\\nAlthough lighter and mostly more compact than SLRs, they’re still quite bulky\\nNot the best in optical engineering, with lenses with a limited maximum aperture\\nThe sensor in most Bridge cameras is less wide than the SLRs, which means you can’t compete with the picture’s result and quality\\n5. Mobile phones\\nAlthough many people look at mobile phones as the distant cousin of the real travel photography gear, and even some people refuse to accept it as such, the truth is the latest generations of mobile phones offer a quality level that was unthinkable just a couple of years ago. They’ve become very popular, and travelers stopped packing a camera for their trip, especially the younger generation.\\nOf course, I mean smartphones when I’m talking about mobile phones. In recent years, they’ve become the norm although there are simpler phones available in the market that don’t have an inbuilt camera.\\nMain Advantages of Smartphones:\\nYou don’t need to carry a separate camera. These days, most people can’t live without their smartphones, and that includes, of course, travelers. Which means, whatever happens, you always pack your phone. If you use it to photograph your adventures and the amazing places you’ll see, that means you don’t need to pack a camera, and it’s one less bulky, heavy item in your luggage.\\nThey’re small and light. By choosing a smartphone to photograph, you’ll gain in comfort. While exploring a new destination, you don’t need to worry about special cases and the safety of walking around with a camera. You put a smartphone in your pocket, and you’re ready to go see the world and photograph.\\nAvailable software. Be it an Android or an iPhone, your smartphone is a small computer. That means you can install a wide range of applications. When it comes to photography that means a world of options: apps to label images, to edit them, to share them on social media, to send them to friends and family as postcards. An infinity of possibilities available right there, without the hassle of downloading or uploading image files and travel with a laptop or a tablet.\\nMain Disadvantages of Smartphones:\\nQuality. There are no miracles. Such a small mechanism with such a small sensor and lens cannot give you the same quality that cameras can, even though a good phone camera sometimes provides better results than most compact cameras models.\\nAutonomy. These days, battery technology hasn’t been able to keep up with all the needs of a well-equipped smartphone. If you use mobile data or WiFi and GPS will probably end a day of sightseeing with a drained battery. If you’re going to photograph, it’s even worse. Of course, all this can be avoided by carrying a power bank, but it’s not very practical and adds another not very light item to your luggage.\\nZoom. Or the absence of one. A smartphone lens is limited in this area. Most times zoom, or part of it, is obtained digitally and that decreases image quality. But, check out Samsung S9+ and its amazing optical zoom feature.\\nDependency. Are you familiar with the saying “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”? What if you depend on your smartphone for everything and there’s a problem, damage, a theft? You lose all your photos and an essential travel tool.\\n6. Action Cameras\\nIt’s not normal for a photography enthusiast to travel only with one of these cameras because it’s a specific gear and, therefore, not as versatile. Travel photography is the type of photography that demands versatility, from the photographer and the equipment.\\nI won’t write about their advantages and disadvantages because they are straightforward: it survives pretty much everything, but it’s clumsy and not very versatile. As I said, it’s not a travel camera. It’s more of a photography accessory for travel photographers who want a crazy shot of a radical situation. A good example? The famous GoPros.\\nBest Accessories for Travel Photography\\nBest Accessories for Travel Photography (photo: Armenia)\\n1. Tripods and other Supports\\nAt times you might need to photograph in poor light conditions. It happens when you want to capture night images or shoot indoors.\\nRemember what happens with the light?\\nIf there’s not a lot of it, the photographer needs to adjust the camera settings to get the shot despite the conditions. He can crank up the ISO while compromising quality and increase the lens aperture to the max. Even so, chances are he’ll need even more light, and there’s only one way to get it: reducing the shutter speed. By doing this, the photographer needs to keep the camera still, making sure the natural motions of his hands don’t make the photo come out blurry.\\nThe most common method is by placing the camera on a tripod, attached to it with a screw.\\nThe quality of a tripod differs, and there are a lot of things that can influence how well a tripod performs. Those factors include how robust their joints are, how smoothly the “joint” on the “head” of the tripod rotates, how high can you extend the feet and how they settle on the ground.\\nIn theory, weight is also a stabilizing factor. But in recent years the manufacturers, aware of how important it is to reduce the weight of the tripod to make the tool more comfortable and functional, have been working on making lighter tripods that don’t compromise on stability.\\nThe higher quality tripods are usually sold in two separate parts: the structure, with “legs” that stretch and “feet” in the end, and the “head” that is like the core part of the tripod.\\nThe docking system is usually standard and should fit with any camera.\\nIf you want a stabilizing tool but can’t picture yourself traveling with a tripod, you can choose a mini tripod. There are some that fit in your pocket, with hinges that bend. They’re light and functional and usually very cheap. Of course, you can’t expect the same kind of stabilization, but they’re a great solution and a compromise for occasional use.\\nMonopods are lighter and easier to carry, but they don’t provide the same degree of stability. They’re ideal for intermediate situations when you just need a little help with stabilizing the camera. Bipods aren’t so frequent nor so easy to find.\\n2. Flash Air Memory Cards\\nInitially developed by Toshiba, these memory cards come with an inbuilt micro WiFi device and communicate with your device without the need to remove them from the camera. On a computer, you can control the connection on a browser while on a smartphone or a tablet, you do it by installing a specific app.\\nIt’s a bit of a trivial device for people who use a laptop or a desktop, but it could come in handy if you’re working with a smartphone, especially for those who usually share images on Instagram and Facebook.\\n3. Carrying Equipment\\nCases, backpacks, bags. Our photography gear has to travel with us. There is a multitude of options and considerations on how to accommodate it, and most of them come down to personal choice, not only about the carrying equipment but the photography gear itself.\\nMinimalists don’t have to think about this as hard as someone who’s willing to travel with a range of photography gear, of course.\\nSo I’ll start by mentioning the most simple way of all: get the camera and “throw it” inside a backpack. If your style is not photographing with a smartphone only, that is.\\nIf you’re carrying just one camera, regardless if it’s an SLR, a compact, a mirrorless, or a bridge, but you’d like to protect it during transportation you can buy a simple case. Some are custom made to fit your camera model; others are one size fits all. You can look at photography gear stores or buy online on eBay for example.\\nIf you have extra accessories or an extra lens for your SLR, there are more elaborate cases with additional compartments. But if you take your travel photography seriously and are determined to travel with a bunch of gear, you’ll really have to invest in a backpack or a bag specifically designed to accommodate a vast number of photography parts.\\nThere are a lot of models and price ranges to choose from, but consider that:\\nA photography gear bag that’s too revealing of what’s inside is a calling card to pickpocketers and petty thieves;\\nChecking it in as checked baggage is a high risk for your photography gear.\\n4. Cleaning Supplies\\nMaybe you don’t need to overpack to bring along cleaning supplies, or perhaps it’s possible to care for your gear once you’re back from your travels.\\nBut if you have enough room in your luggage and you like to keep things clean, you may want to pack a spray and a cloth to clean lenses, as well as a blower that’s used to clear dust particles lodged in sensitive areas, without touching them.\\nIt’s particularly useful for when there are dust particles in the sensor (for cameras where you can change lenses). Alternatively, there are portable compressed air systems that do the same.\\nOther Photography Accessories\\nIn addition to all the extras I mentioned above, many other accessories fit your photography style and personal preferences.\\nA remote control could be useful to reduce the camera vibration on a tripod when shooting. Or to take that group photo with friends without running to beat the timer. Or to photograph wild animals in a situation when you don’t want to be near the camera when shooting.\\nTravelers may also want to protect the camera from environmental aggressions, and there are plenty of accessories for that, especially for the more common camera models. There are custom made accessories that are assembled like an armor around the camera. And adaptors that you place over the LCD and that work as a shutter. Without mentioning the protective films you can put over the screens and the waterproof cases that work like trench coats for our cameras.\\nIf you want a head start on advanced photography, buying a good external flash is important. It’s a source of artificial light that you can use more elaborately, having more control and more power.\\nAlthough the generalized use of software to enhance photos turned using physical filters obsolete, there are some situations when they’re irreplaceable. Like in cases when there’s too much light that you need to reduce artificially, as opposed to the more frequent problem of not having enough light. In those situations, a specially designed filter over the lens is precious. This is just an example. Other filters come in handy, like a good polarizer that reduces or increases light reflections to give depth to the blue tones in the sky.\\nLastly, you have to consider packing extra batteries and memory cards. If you think they’re necessary, of course. Everything will depend on your gear and your photography style. Those who use an SLR camera will need less battery, but maybe, because of the size of the sensor, you’ll need cards with more storage space.\\nThose traveling with mirrorless cameras will probably want to pack an extra pair of batteries because the average autonomy of these cameras is around 300 photos with one full charge. It’s not much unless you don’t take that many pictures on a traveling day.\\nThose who do travel photography with a smartphone can also carry extra batteries in their pockets, but it’s not the best idea. Usually, smartphone batteries go through a complicated calibration process and changing them all the time will mess things up. In the end, you may be using batteries that are physically okay, but that won’t last that long.\\nThe best is to use power banks, big batteries in a functional packaging that allow transferring energy between them and your phone. There are power banks with different storage capacities. In most cases, a good power bank of 10,000 mah is enough to charge your smartphone completely four consecutive times, without needing to recharge. When buying a power bank, choose one that can charge at least two devices at the same time, and that has an inbuilt battery level. And, of course, make sure it’s compact and easy to carry.\\nRegarding cards, you can invest a little more and get a 128 Gb one. A card this big will give you significant autonomy. Even if you travel the world for months, chances are you won’t be able to fill it unless you do video as well.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Having been living and working near the Erg Chebbi Dunes for four years, previous involvement with the local community facilitated my reception of this type of invitation. Although many people no longer marry in such a way, one of the grooms chose to have this kind of traditional ceremony so that local youth could witness and experience how the Berber marry in this region of the Sahara.\\nBerber Marriage in Hassilabied village, Sahara Desert, Morocco – Best Travel Experiences\\nRiding a camel, the fiancés arrived at the marriage campsite in Hassilabied village.

If you can’t travel light with just a small 20-liter backpack, pack your belongings in two separate luggage pieces: the main one, for bulkier items that are worthless and that you can easily replace (like clothes for example) and another smaller one that you’ll carry with you at all times. Carry it with you on flights, on bus rides, and while exploring the city and leave the main backpack safely stored in a locker. This is one way to avoid losing your essential belongings or having them stolen (at least in an easy way).\\n4. Carry the Money in a Money Belt\\nCarry the Money in a Money Belt\\nCarry the Money in a Money Belt. A money belt is the safest way to carry around cash. Even if you avoid using cash, you’ll always need some while traveling. A money belt looks like a regular belt but has a secret compartment with a zipper. Remember it’s a belt, so there isn’t much space in this secret compartment, just enough to keep some rolled up bills or a folded paper document. It’s one of the safest places. There aren’t many hostel petty thieves that go through the trouble of scouring the belt on a pair of pants lying on the bed. Even in the worst-case scenario of an armed robbery, it’s unlikely the thief will remember to ask for your belt. For a pick-pocketer, this hiding place is hard to detect and virtually impossible to get to. And, unless when you’re asleep, your money will always be with you at all times.\\n5. Always Pack Earplugs\\nAlways Pack Earplugs\\nAlways Pack Earplugs. Traveling is a true festival for our senses. Different scents, breathtaking views, exotic tastes, new sounds. However, what happens when we don’t want these sounds? When we want to sleep in a room where someone is snoring? That moment that you need to focus on work? Or when we want to muffle the sound of a baby crying on a plane? Or when we’re so exhausted that all we want is complete silence? Those are the times when we resort to the fantastic earplugs that give us the quiet we need or at least reduce the noises that disturb us.  \\nThere are different options available most of the light, small, and ideal to pack for our trips. The most common earplugs are made of silicon, but the ones that provide the best insulation are made of wax, sold in small boxes of 12. There’s something magical about creating a barrier between our brain and a noisy environment, and it makes all the difference between a rough night and a sound sleep.\\n6. Don’t Pack Anything You Can’t Afford to Lose\\nDon’t Pack Anything You Can’t Afford to Lose\\nDon’t Pack Anything You Can’t Afford to Lose. Any serial traveler will tell you that losing stuff or getting them stolen comes with the territory.\\nIn some ways more serious than others, almost all of us have lost something when traveling or were robbed somewhere in the world. Of course, these things are part of life, even when we’re home.\\nBut when you’re traveling, the odds of something less fortunate happening are higher.\\nSo, here’s my advice: don’t pack anything that you can’t afford to lose, from an emotional or a financial point of view. I try packing things that I won’t regret losing, no matter how much of a nuisance it might be.\\nDon’t carry sentimental items or that top-range phone you saved for so long to buy. Remember, carry only things that won’t have a big impact on you if you lose them.\\nThat way you can relax, focusing more on all the wonderful experiences the world has in store for you and less on safety measures to secure your assets.\\n7. Keep in Mind that Things Can and Will Go Wrong\\nKeep in Mind that Things Can and Will Go Wrong\\nKeep in Mind that Things Can and Will Go Wrong. Let’s keep it real: when you’re planning for so many things, chances are some things will go wrong. Unexpected things that you can’t control or predict.\\nUnpleasant surprises triggered by someone else’s incompetence, or chance, or bad luck. Call it what you will, but never expect that everything is going to happen exactly according to plan.\\nIf you’re mentally prepared for the worst, you’ll have a better reaction to whatever happens. And above all don’t blame yourself. It happens to everyone.\\n8. Keep Several Records of Your Most Important Information\\nKeep Several Records of Your Most Important Information\\nKeep Several Records of Your Most Important Information. When reaching a city, you’re supposed to look for your host at a specific address, and you even kept his phone number in case something goes wrong. But where do you keep that information? In your email? A note on your smartphone? A page in your notebook? Wherever it is, it’s best if you keep this information in more than one place. The more vital the information, the more records you should keep.\\n9. Ask Your Accommodation for Their Business Card\\nAsk Your Accommodation for Their Business Card\\nAsk Your Accommodation for Their Business Card. The moment you reach your accommodation, ask them for their business card. When you’re out exploring the city you may need that information in case you get lost or want to take a taxi back to the hotel. It’s also useful in case of an accident.\\n10. Make Sure All Your Photos Are Safe\\nMake Sure All Your Photos Are Safe\\nMake Sure All Your Photos Are Safe. Do you save your photos on your mobile phone? Just your mobile phone? Have you imagined how you’d feel if you’d lost all your pictures or if your camera got stolen say on your last day of a 6-month trip through Asia? It’s best if you do all you can to prevent this from happening.\\nYour options depend on what photography gear you use. The pictures taken with a phone are smaller and easier to save than the ones made with a top-range SLR. In the first case, you should be fine using a pen drive or uploading the photos to a cloud system like Dropbox or Google Drive. If your photos are larger, the process is slightly more complicated: maybe the only way to save your photos is to carry an external hard drive or a small laptop, or both.\\nOne of the methods I use the most is asking people I meet when traveling to keep a copy of my photos on their computers until I return home.\\n11. Grow the Habit of Checking Everything Before Checking Out\\nGrow the Habit of Checking Everything Before Checking Out\\nGrow the Habit of Checking Everything Before Checking Out. I don’t know if there are statistics for these situations, but if there are I’m pretty sure most travel-related misplacements or losses happen when people check out of their hotels. Clothes under the bed covers, the wallet that fell behind the bed, the charger you left on the power outlet, the hygiene kit in the bathroom, the book on the table at the lounge area. Of course, we all take a quick look before closing the door but get used to checking everything thoroughly. Start with the places where it’s more likely to leave something behind. Then double-check if all your most valuable items are properly packed.\\nIn many cases, losing something that’s not as valuable can be fixed. Maybe you can go back before leaving, or perhaps you were planning to return in a few days or weeks. But in other cases, especially when you’re a flight away and in a faraway continent, there’s no way to get those items back.\\n12. Use a Proper Travel Towel\\nUse a Proper Travel Towel\\nUse a Proper Travel Towel. I won’t even suggest you pack a travel towel. Except on smaller trips where you’re staying at hotels, you’ll most likely need a towel. The problem is many travelers pack the kind of towel they use at home: big, heavy, and hard to dry. These days you can find synthetic fiber towels suitable for a traveler’s needs, available in different sizes and easy to pack inside a backpack, that feel light on the shoulder, and that dry in a matter of minutes.\\n13. Don’t Exchange Currency at a Country’s Entry Point\\nDon’t Exchange Currency at a Country’s Entry Point\\nDon’t Exchange Currency at a Country’s Entry Point. Even if you don’t trust ATMs or even if your destination requires you to exchange cash, try not to do it at a country’s entry point. Of course, you’ll need some money to pay for transportation and other first expenses. But, in general, the exchange rates at airports or international train stations don’t benefit the customer. Research, ask around. But don’t do most of your currency exchange on arrival, unless your research shows you it’s best like it happens in most ground borders in Central America.\\n14. Learn to Deal with Not Having Internet\\nLearn to Deal with Not Having Internet\\nLearn to Deal with Not Having the Internet. The Internet plays an important role in our daily lives. We need it to communicate, to research, to entertain ourselves. But do we need it every day? Some people have become addicted to the Internet, and when they don’t have it, they feel jumpy, impatient, lost, vulnerable. But it’s possible, and easy, to go for long periods without any Internet access. Going back to the old pleasures of life is an art that once mastered is extremely rewarding: read a book, talk to a stranger, think, observe. Those are wonderful things you can do when you need to put the laptop or the phone aside.\\n15. If You’re Leaving Early, Pack the Night Before\\nIf You’re Leaving Early Pack the Night Before\\nIf You’re Leaving Early, Pack the Night Before. It’s happened to a lot of us: we’re sound asleep at a hostel, and suddenly an alarm goes off. So far so good. Then it happens. The person starts packing everything inside a million plastic bags with that annoying sound. Turns the light on and off. Goes to the bathroom. Comes back. More plastic noises and zippers. Goes back into the bathroom. Turns on another light.\\nWhat about if we all pack what we can the night before (some things are inevitably last minute), apologize to our roommates in advance about the alarm that will go off at dawn, and go to bed ready to leave in the morning quickly and without making a sound? It’s a win-win situation for everyone. We also reduce the chances of leaving something behind, that we can’t see in a dark corner or because we’re too sleepy to notice.\\n16. Use a notebook, really!\\nUse a notebook, really! There’s the legendary Moleskine, but you don’t have to spend so much money on a notebook. There are other similar products available that have the same purpose. A notebook is an ideal place to carry all the needed information about your travel plan, but it’s also good to take notes of all the things you think you’ll remember later but you won’t. It’s essential if you have a travel blog, but generally speaking, I bet you’ll regret it if you don’t keep track of your travel adventures in a notebook. You can do it on a computer, but it’s just not the same thing. The laptop is not on all the time, and it feels different.\\n17. Get Lost in a New City\\nGet Lost in a New City\\nGet Lost in a New City. Literally. Wander, let yourself go, turn here and there without thinking twice, let yourself into unknown streets, exploring and leaving rational thoughts behind. You’ll come across unexpected things. Some romantic nooks, maybe a mural, or an abandoned factory. Not all of your findings will be beautiful, but this should be about the experience, not finding beauty.\\n18. Get Up Early\\nGet Up Early\\nGet Up Early. Waking at the crack of dawn comes with two advantages. Firstly, assuming you enjoy photographing, the light at sunrise is one of the most fascinating lights, keeping steady until the sun is high in the sky. Secondly, and most important because at sunset you’ll have similar light, you’ll get to see the sights without the crowds of tourists. In some places that are both beautiful and touristy, that’s extremely important like the historic centers of Prague or Antigua, Guatemala. What a difference it makes to visit those beautiful streets and to photograph them without the crowds.\\n19. Keep a Copy of Your Most Important Documents in the Cloud\\nKeep a Copy of Your Most Important Documents in the Cloud\\nKeep a Copy of Your Most Important Documents in the Cloud. To make sure you’ll be able to recover your most important documents in case something happens, keep a copy at a cloud system like Dropbox or Google Drive. You can also email them to yourself, using an email account like Gmail or Hotmail. That way, in case the worse happens, and you lose your passport, for example, it’s easy to get a new travel document from your embassy. Other documents you should keep a copy of include rental car vouchers, boarding passes, and train e-tickets.\\n20. Carry a Mini-Pharmacy with You\\nCarry a Mini-Pharmacy with You\\nCarry a Mini-Pharmacy with You. Select a few medicines to take with you. Don’t worry much about variety and quantity, unless, of course, you suffer from a chronic health condition. It’s amazing how something so small can provide us with the relief we need at times. Each person has their concerns and is more vulnerable to specific changes, but here is my suggestion for a travel-size pharmacy: painkillers like Ibuprofen 600 for toothaches, headaches, and mild colds. Antihistamine for bug bites or unexpected allergic reactions. Diarrhea pills to prevent any accidents in a 15-hour train ride. Tablets for motion sickness for a more comfortable ferry trip, because you never know when you might need one. Nervous folks may want to include a mild sedative to take during stressful situations.\\n21. Carry an Extension Cord or a Multiple Entry Charger\\nCarry an Extension Cord or a Multiple Entry Charger\\nCarry an Extension Cord or a Multiple Entry Charger. Most of the time your room will only have one or two power outlets, but you need to charge your mobile phone, the camera battery, the laptop, and then the devices of your travel partner. In a dorm room at a hostel, things can get even uglier, with only one or two outlets for ten beds. An extension cord will solve your problems and also others’. Considering that you can now charge most devices via a USB port, carry a multiple entry charger with two, three, or even four entry points. Make sure it’s powerful enough to charge all your devices because some of them don’t have enough amps to do it.\\n22. Don’t Forget the Plastic Bags\\nDon’t Forget the Plastic Bags\\nDon’t Forget the Plastic Bags. Supermarket plastic bags are useful, light, and don’t take up much space. Three or four neatly folded bags fit anywhere in your backpack and have multiple uses: after a few weeks on the road, maybe your shoes smell funny, and you won’t have the guts to take them off at someone’s house, with the smell spreading across the room while people give you the side-eye. Time to use a plastic bag. Laundry ends up frequently in one of these bags. They’re also used to protect your most vulnerable items from the rain. Not to mention their initial purpose of carrying groceries. Lastly, they’re also useful to organize things in your luggage like keeping chargers and cables together or books.\\n23. Dark Clothing vs Light Clothing\\nDark Clothing vs Light Clothing\\nDark Clothing vs Light Clothing. Unless you feel lucky, you’ll usually do two separate laundry loads: one for your dark clothes and one for your light clothes. That’s what everyone does. And that’s why it’s a good idea to pack only dark clothes (or only light clothes) when you’re traveling for extensive periods. Doing your laundry at a hostel is expensive and often rushed, so you won’t be able to do two loads. You’ll probably have enough laundry for two loads anyway.\\n24. Keep Track of Your Finances\\nKeep Track of Your Finances\\nKeep Track of Your Finances. Losing track of your money is easy. At one point we can’t even believe that’s all we have left. Where did everything go? We imagine the worst possible scenarios that we lost it or got robbed, but that’s hardly the case. The truth is if you don’t keep track of your finances, it feels like money flies off your wallet. The traveler benefits if they establish a daily spend and keep track of all expenses to keep it under control. You can use a notebook or one of the many available phone apps for finances.\\nFor several years I have been using the PRO version of Travel Money.\\n25. Get an Emergency Snack\\nGet an Emergency Snack\\nGet an Emergency Snack. Always expect the unexpected. A delayed flight, an out-of-service ATM, shops closed, a night out that lasted longer than anticipated. And in the middle of all those situations, you get hungry. It’s always a good idea to keep an emergency snack on you. Something small, light, and with enough calories to keep you going. It’s a small action that could save you a lot of unpleasantness.\\n26. Pack the Oldest Clothes in Your Wardrobe\\nPack the Oldest Clothes in Your Wardrobe\\nWhy? First of all, because traveling is a dangerous activity for clothes. They go through a lot of wear and tear, in places with thorns and pointy rocks. Second of all, you can start throwing them in the trash on the last days of your trip instead of packing them in the laundry bag, and it’s a weight off your shoulders. Thirdly, you can always shop for nice things along your trip, replacing the old clothes turned into rags.\\n27. Allow Yourself to Indulge in a nice hotel from Time to Time\\nAllow Yourself to Indulge in a nice hotel from Time to Time\\nIf you’re traveling on a shoestring budget for a while, take some time to gift yourself something nice and slightly more expensive. After night after night sleeping in a hostel, staying in a private room at a hotel with some comfort it’s excellent for the body and the soul. Or take a one-hour flight instead of that painfully long 15-hour bus trip.\\n28. Travel Light\\nTravel Light\\nLearn to leave behind what’s not essential for your trip. In fact, nothing is essential, but each person prioritizes different things. Work on your priority list, taking off items, volume, and weight. Ideally, you want to travel with a backpack that you don’t need to check in on a flight or a bus. One that allows you to walk all day comfortably, making the best of layovers in new cities, and the free time between flights or between train trips. One that’s not an issue when you need to check out at noon, but your trip isn’t until 11 at night. One that’s not an obstacle between you and a hike or a climb. There’s nothing but benefits in packing everything you need inside a 20-liter backpack or less.\\n29. Take Care of Your Body\\nTake Care of Your Body\\nYou’ll feel better if you take care of your body often. And if you feel better, you’ll enjoy your trip more. If you have a toothache, eating a chocolate bar could be the difference between a week of torture or days well spent. A long bus ride on a winding road is better after a good night sleep than with a hangover. Why suffer through sunburn after a walk in the desert if you could have worn a hat and sunscreen. Take good care of your body, follow the general advice and be mindful of your choices, and benefit from feeling good about yourself.\\n30. Avoid Restaurants with English Menus\\nAvoid Restaurants with English Menus\\nEspecially the ones with signs that read “We speak English.” Unless you’re so tired, you don’t mind paying a high price for the simpler alternative. You’ll eat better and cheaper at local restaurants, that don’t cater to money-spending tourists. Not to mention the priceless experience of having a meal among locals going about their daily routines.\\n31. Go On Free Tours\\nGo On Free Tours\\nFree Tours are usually organized in the most touristy cities by companies or freelancers, following a simple concept: someone knows their city well and volunteers to take tourists on a tour for free. What’s the catch? There isn’t one. The traveler is expected to tip the guide in the end, but it’s not mandatory. If you’re wondering, around 5 Euros should be enough.\\nFree tours are usually geared toward young backpackers. They’re an excellent way to get the first feel of a new place, especially in large cities. You can get an overview of the destination, clear some doubts with the guide and other people taking part on the tour, and make a note of the places you want to take a closer look. To find free tours, google “free tours London” for example.\\n32. Save Money by Going on a Picnic\\nSave Money by Going on a Picnic\\nIf you’re traveling on a tight budget, go to a supermarket to buy supplies for a picnic instead of stopping for lunch at a restaurant. Make some sandwiches, boil some eggs, and pack a piece of fruit. Not only will you eat for a fraction of the price, but you’ll save time by not having to wait for a menu, ordering, and waiting for your food. For a picnic, all you need is to find the perfect spot, sit, and have the cheap fast meal of your choice.\\n33. Look for Free Activities\\nLook for Free Activities\\nDo some research online before you reach a destination. We used to do this for typically expensive destinations, but with tourism growth in countries like Iran or Sri Lanka, sometimes you need to pay higher fees to visit the most popular tourist attractions. If you need to stay on budget, you can find interesting things to do without spending money. Even in places with an admission fee, in some days, schedules, and seasons tickets are free or reduced price.\\nThat is the case with the Louvre Museum, for example, where tickets at the end of the day are sold with a discount. But there are similar cases in all cities. It benefits you to research and find out.\\n34. Use GPS\\nUse GPS\\nThese days most mobile phones have inbuilt GPS. Use it. And not just to find your hotel. Let’s imagine you’re on the bus from the airport to the city center and, suddenly, long before you reach your destination you see a magnificent building or something else you’d like to visit. How do you find it later? You can try to memorize landmarks, street names, but it’s not that easy. Unless you’re using the GPS and pinpoint the exact location.\\nUse it to plan your trip, create a collection of points of interest, bus and train stations you’re going to use, the museums you’d like to visit, where you’ll sleep. Of course, some of them may already be on Google Maps but some may not.\\nFor me, the best offline application for having free maps and without being connected to the Internet is Maps.me.\\n35. Leave to the Airport as Early as Possible\\nLeave to the Airport as Early as Possible\\nIt’s not hard to leave to the airport as early as possible to reach in time. Especially when you stop to think what will cost you if you miss that return flight from New Zealand. Of course, if we’re talking about a local connection or a flight within Europe, there are fewer consequences, and I suggest you weigh being early against the effects of reaching too late. Keep in mind that unpredictable things can happen to us. Our bus might break down. The traffic could get worse because of an accident. The TSA lines at the airport could be huge.\\n36. Use a Good Selection of Travel Apps on Your Phone\\nUse a Good Selection of Travel Apps on Your Phone\\nEach person will have their favorites, but there’s a group of travel apps that everyone uses. Prices in a new currency could be confusing, especially when the conversion rate is something like 0.37 instead of 0.50. It’s important to have an app that quickly converts currency, especially when you’re in a new country every three days. Google Translate is also a valuable tool, especially since we’ve been able to use it offline (choose the languages you’ll be using beforehand and download the files with the corresponding dictionaries). Not to mention how useful phone maps are, especially the ones we can use without an Internet connection. Then there are some free and paid travel guides, and specific apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, AirBnB, or Skyscanner. Each traveler should consider their needs and turn their mobile phone into a powerful multi-use tool for travelers.\\n37. Check for Compatibilities…\\nCheck for Compatibilities\\nWe all travel with a series of items we assume we can use wherever we are. But check for compatibilities first. Can we use our debit and credit cards in all countries we’re traveling to? You might think that you can but for example in Cuba, São Tomé e Príncipe, and Iran you will really need cash because they don’t take plastic. At least our plastic. Will the plugs in our chargers and devices fit all outlets while traveling? If they don’t, and there’s a good chance they won’t, you need to pack a converter. Will our phones work? You might need to buy a local SIM card. There are countries where our SIM cards won’t work at all.\\n38. Keep Your Friends and Family Posted\\nKeep Your Friends and Family Posted\\nIf you have a travel plan, give your closest friends and family a copy. Are you the kind of person that goes with the flow? Try to keep them up to date of your location and your activities, especially if you’re traveling alone. If you’re in an accident or faced with a severe problem, it will be easier to get the help you need as fast as possible.\\n39. Check All Visa Costs and Exit Fees in Advance\\nCheck All Visa Costs and Exit Fees in Advance\\nWhile for many countries you don’t need to get a visa in advance, you might need to pay for one on arrival. And they don’t accept all currencies. It’s best to check beforehand what currency they take and how much will it cost. Also, keep in mind that they may refuse to accept marked or overused bills.\\nLikewise, you should check for exit fees. There’s nothing as unpleasant as reaching the airport, without any local currency, to find out you have to pay to leave the country. Best case scenario, you’ll have to exchange money at a very high rate. Worst case scenario, you’ll lose the flight. Keep in mind that some exit fees are applied only to how you exit the country, and they could affect only airport borders.\\n40. Talk to Your Bank About Using Your Cards Abroad\\nTalk to Your Bank About Using Your Cards Abroad\\nSome travelers find themselves with their credit and debit cards blocked by their banks because they’re using them in remote locations. The bank flags these situations as potential fraud and immediately blocks the card. It’s an inconvenience, to say the least. The last thing you want is to be in New Guinea, and you suddenly realize you can’t access your funds, dealing with a situation that in many cases you can’t solve. It’s best to gather all relevant information before you leave and talk to your account manager to discuss what to do if something like this happens.\\n41. Find Out if There Are Any Special Events at the Places You’ll Go\\nFind Out if There Are Any Special Events at the Places You’ll Go\\nIf you have a general outline of your travel plan, it’s good to know if there’ll be any special events at the places you’re traveling to before you leave. Those can be special holidays, festivals, or one-time-only events. Some of them might be interesting, and you can miss out if you don’t research your destination thoroughly. Besides, in some situations, it’s worth changing your travel schedule to be at a specific location in time for one of those events.\\nOn the other hand, if there’s an event attracting people from all over the country and foreigners, it will be harder to find accommodation or an affordable flight or train ticket. If it’s a massive event and you’re not that into it, you’ll want to avoid that destination around that time.\\n42. Check Your Passport Validity\\nCheck Your Passport Validity\\nDespite the expiry date on your travel document, most countries demand a more long expiry date. Usually, six months from the date of arrival in the country. If you’re traveling keep this in mind and, if needed, carry the new passport with you. Check how many blank pages you have on your passport and make sure there’s enough room for all the visas and stamps you’ll need.\\n43. Pack a Scarf\\nPack a Scarf\\nThere are countless advantages of packing a scarf, or a Keffiyeh scarf, it’s like a Swiss army knife for travelers, and it’s incredibly light and small. You can use it to cover your eyes when sleeping, it protects your neck from the freezing mountain wind, it doubles as a hat in the scorching heat, and it doubles as a towel, an improvised belt, a bag, a pillow, a rope, and so much more.\\n44. Smile and Treat Locals Respectfully\\nSmile and Treat Locals Respectfully\\nA smile is one of the few universal “words” that doesn’t get lost in translation. It’s a sign of friendship, of good intentions. As a traveler (and, well, as a person), you’ll gain so much more just for smiling. Some people may react to it indifferently, but you’ll never lose for smiling. And with a smile comes respect. It’s amazing how many travelers, even young backpackers, treat people in the countries they deem inferior. If you replace your snobbish attitude with unpretentiousness, your disdain with respect, you’ll reap what you sowed at the time you need the most, and so will they.\\n45. Talk to Border Patrol Officers in a Straightforward but Calm Manner\\nTalk to Border Patrol Officers in a Straightforward but Calm Manner\\nWhen entering a new country, you’ll need to talk to at least one immigration or border patrol officer. It’s convenient for you that the conversation flows in a way that pleases the officer. Especially in more complicated countries like the USA or Israel. To achieve that, you must talk in a balanced way, not too rude and not too friendly. Don’t smile or laugh too much. Be friendly and answer all questions correctly. And never ever be aggressive.\\n46. Take Passport Type Photos with You\\nTake Passport Type Photos with You\\nThese photos are practically weightless and take up very little space, but they can come in handy when you least expect it. Maybe you’ll have to cross a border where you need this type of photo, and they charge you a high fee for it. Or perhaps you’re visiting a country where they request a photo for something surprising like buying a SIM card. Or perhaps you’re visiting a remote community, and you’d like to give your picture as a souvenir to someone special. It’s easy to carry, and it can be priceless in some situations.\\n47. Read About the Local Customs Before You Go\\nRead About the Local Customs Before You Go\\nAlthough most people are tolerant of tourists, it’s best if you learn about local etiquette so you don’t do anything they might be considered offensive. As I said, most people are tolerant of tourists. They understand we come from different parts of the world and we don’t mean to be disrespectful. We just don’t know about certain local customs and habits. But some places are so remote, and people there aren’t so used to foreigners, that they might react badly to these involuntary offenses. You’ll really have to research and learn. Using your common sense is not enough. Some things that feel okay to us might be an insult in some cultures. Like eating with your left hand or crossing your legs when sitting.\\n48. Keep Safe from Pick-Pocketers\\nKeep Safe from Pick-Pocketers\\nI’m sure you’re thinking, “of course!” You and the thousands of people who fall victims of this type of crime every day. The truth is that they’re out in the streets making their living at the expense of careless people, especially tourists. Don’t think you can outsmart them. For a pick-pocketer, stealing is a way of life, and he’s really very good at it. The best way to not give them a chance os to carry nothing worth stealing or very little. It’s a peace of mind to know you don’t have to mind the crowd around you inside a subway car on rush hour. Just because there’s nothing on us to steal. Carry a small amount of cash, leave your wallet at the hotel, and don’t carry everything in the same place. Keep credit cards, money, and a cheap mobile phone in separate locations.\\n49. Ask for Permission Before Photographing People\\nAsk for Permission Before Photographing People\\nIt’s easier to ask someone if you can photograph them, even if it’s just with a gesture than facing their anger when they realize you’re sneaking a photo. In some cultures, it’s even difficult to get permission. People don’t want to be photographed for many personal beliefs and, in this case, you can still risk it, but you have to be discreet — not look at the camera, pointing the camera at a crowd, and making sure the flash is off. But this is the last resort if you really need that shot. Always ask. Beware that some people might charge you for a picture. Try to be very clear about it or get ready for a different kind of wrath.\\n50. Get Used to Packing a Roll of Toilet Paper\\nGet Used to Packing a Roll of Toilet Paper\\nIt seems obvious, but I’m sure some people don’t remember the importance of having a roll of toilet paper with them at all times or at least a decent amount. Because it’s light and doesn’t take up much space after you compress it, you can take one from home. Then, while traveling, pack it inside your everyday backpack. You never know when you’ll need it. Don’t assume that public restrooms, even the ones at restaurants, have toilet paper available.\\n51. Take photos of yourself\\nTake photos of yourself\\nYou probably have this habit already, but it’s easy to forget to take pictures of yourself especially if you’re a solo traveler. You can’t work around this later. If you’re not the selfie type, lend someone your camera and ask them to take your picture. If you don’t have a camera and happen to meet some people along the way, ask them to email you any photos you’ve taken together.\\n52.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nBOAT EGYPT TO SUDAN\\nSome journeys stay permanently in our minds. No matter how many years more you accumulate on the road, specific adventures stay in our memory as the best travel experiences.\\nI love to travel by boat. It doesn’t matter if traveling in the Amazing River, exploring the Galapagos, or an expedition to Antarctica. All of my previous boat trips were unforgettable. Going from Egypt to Sudan by boat holds a significant place in my most important personal journeys.\\nCrossing from Egypt to Sudan can be done on a regular bus trip. But there were times that you couldn’t just take a bus ride and travel all the way from Egypt to Sudan.\\nConsequently, the longer, and more expensive boat trip from Egypt to Sudan is becoming neglected by local people, and probably in the near future, this journey will be gone forever.\\nPerfectly knowing that I could cross the border from Egypt to Sudan overland, I still decided to make the legendary trip up the Nile River from Aswan to Wadi Halfa.\\nBoat vs. Bus\\nEgypt to Sudan by boat\\nBy boat: Weekly departures. Price about 29 Euros (port entrance fee + boat ticket). The duration of the trip is around 20 hours. You make the passport formalities and get stamped at Aswan port for Egypt and on the boat for Sudan.\\nBy bus: Daily buses. Price about 19 Euros (bus + ferry boat). The duration of the trip is around 14 hours. You make the passport formalities and get stamped at the border of Egypt and furthermore ahead in Sudan.\\nSudan visa in Aswan\\nA tourist visa is required to enter Sudan for most nationalities. The most complex issue about this journey is conciliating the moment you get your Sudanese visa with the weekly boat departure. This means that depending on the day you get your visa, you might need to stay in Aswan for a couple of days before you embark.\\nAlso, the exact day of departure always changes. My boat departed on a Wednesday, but usually, it used to leave every Thursday. Nowadays it seems to be leaving every Sunday. So I stayed four nights in Aswan before being able to go to Sudan.\\nI delivered all the necessary documents to the Sudanese Consulate in Aswan on Monday at 9 am. I got my visa on Wednesday.\\nDon’t forget to bring:\\nYour passport:\\nA copy of your passport;\\nA copy of your Egyptian visa;\\n2 passport-sized photos;\\n$50 USD (It seems the visa price increased to $150 USD).\\nBoat leaving & Closed consulate\\nNow, the two tricky things were that I got my visa on the same day the boat was leaving, and, the day that the consulate was closed. The friendly lady at the consulate guaranteed that although the office would be closed, I was going to get my visa.\\nWhen I got there on Wednesday morning the guard just told me to go away because the consulate was closed. I was able to explain my situation and trying to be as friendly and convincing as possible, he went inside to ask if there was any visa waiting to be picked up. I got my passport and the Sudan visa sticker and I was ready to leave.\\nSince it was on the way, and I still had a couple of hours, I profited to visit Philae Island before heading to the port. It was nice to return to Philae after a decade of absence when I was in Egypt back in 2008.\\nThe trip\\nThe boat trip from Aswan to Wadi Halfa was amazing and memorable. I arrived at Aswan Port around 12 pm, and the boat left around 3 pm. You need time to fill up some papers with the police, go thru passport formalities and getting yourself a boat ticket to Sudan.\\nAlthough I had my place in the lower deck, I decided to make my trip in the upper open deck of the boat. I even slept outside, as many local people did also. Around 5:30 am we reached the Great Temple of Abu Simbel.\\nPeople on the boat are very friendly and curious. Most locals want to take selfies with foreigners and you’re often offered tea and cookies. The boat reached Wadi Halfa at 10:00 the next day. On the boat, there was also a foreign solo traveler, on her way to Sudan.\\nDon’t forget:\\nGet to Aswan beforehand;\\nYou need to know the exact day the boat leaves;\\nYou need 2 to 7 days to get your Visa issued;\\nIt seems the visa price went up. It might now cost $150 USD;\\nBe friendly at the consulate;\\nSome times people are refused visa processing in Aswan and have to go to Cairo;\\nGet to the port a few hours in advance;\\nPeople are very friendly and most want to take selfies with you. Be patient and kind;\\nVery easy passport formalities and Egypt departure stamp at Aswan port;\\nVery easy passport formalities and Sudan arrival stamp inside the boat. You have to deliver your passport and they will give it back to you when arriving at Wadi Halfa. Confirm your stamp before you go out of the boat.\\nPersonal insight: Some people find it strange how I got my Sudan visa in 48 hours. First of all, I go by speaking Arabic. Secondly, I see reports of people going to the consulate, being arrogant and demanding a visa. Well, things don’t work that way. Reasonably, the service they provide will most likely depend on the way you approach people and how friendly you are. Your issue will be resolved as their personal goal and as a favor rather than a service. Thirdly, if you cause a good impression, people will be honored to make your situation happen. Concluding that, If you boss around being rude and demanding things, you will probably be sent to Cairo embassy.\\nStep by Step from Aswan to Wadi Halfa\\nTime\\nDescription\\nPhoto\\n9:00\\nAswan hotel check-out.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nVAN LIFE EXTREME\\nThere are those places in the world everyone knows about. And, there are other places that no one has a clue. No Man’s Lands are buffer zones between countries. How about a 24-hour travel guide of what to do at a No Man’s Land in some remote mountains of Central Asia? I will explain…\\nHolidays in the No Man’s Land\\nAt a certain point in my 1-year camper van journey, the next leg of the trip was to cross from Kyrgyzstan into Tajikistan, through the Pamir Highway – M41 road. I needed to drive from Sary Tash in Kyrgyzstan, to Murghab via Karakul village, already on the Tajik side.\\nBut, altitude was the factor slowing me down.\\nWhile in the Pamir Mountains, and because I was traveling with my 2.5-year-old son, altitude sickness was always something to take into account. So, due to excessive altitude, my wife and I decided not to cross into Tajikistan as soon we got rid of Kyrgyzstan border checkpoint formalities.\\nFrom the Dor-Doba Kyrgyz checkpoint at 3,450 m we couldn’t just drive 22 km to the Tajik checkpoint at 4,187 meters through the Kyzylart Pass at 4,318 m. We required some time for the boy to adapt before we adventure into the 4200 meters high mountains.\\nWe needed 24 hours…\\nWe drove out of Kyrgyzstan border early morning and went inside the no man’s land to explore the area close to the 4000 meters (13,123 feet). Although before sunset we came back to 3600 meters (11,811 feet).\\nMost of the time I drive slowly because I want to profit from the places I visit. And, in such a beautiful mountain scenario such as the Pamirs, the icy roads and spare time, made me enjoy the occasion and appreciate the fantastic scenery. And there we were, in the middle of nowhere. Literally.\\nWhat to do in the No Man’s Land between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan:\\nDrive slow and enjoy\\nHiking\\nFill up water containers with spring water from the mountain\\nI drove\\nMy wife drove\\nEven my kid drove\\nCook lunch\\nEat cookies\\nDrink warm tea\\nThe altitude\\nThe altitude differences of the mountain road from Sary Tash to Murghab:\\nSary Tash 3,170 m to Dor-Doba KG checkpoint 3,450 m = 26 km\\nDor-Doba KG checkpoint to Kyzul Art Pass 4,318 m = 21 km\\nKyzyl Art Pass to KyzulArt TJ checkpoint 4,187 m = 1.6 km\\nKyzyl Art TJ border to Uy Bulak Pass 4,232m m = 21 km\\nUy Bulak Pass to Karakul village 3,922 m = 30 km\\nKarakul village to Ak Baytal pass 4,710 m = 59 km\\nAk Baytal pass to Murghab 3,618 m = 74 km\\nSary Tash to Murghab = 233 km\\nTimeline\\n11:03\\nArriving at the Kyrgyz border post\\n11:49\\nDriving out of the Kyrgyz border post\\n11:56\\nFilling up the campervan 100-liter water tank and 20-liter jerricans with fresh spring water from the mountain.\\n12:25\\nNice photo opportunity at 3570 meters.\\n12:30\\nThe first ones to pass through that morning.\\n12:59\\nDry river valley above 3,700 m.\\n13:16\\nStop to have lunch around 3,800 m.\\n13:30\\nMaking lunch.\\n15:06\\nEating lunch.\\n17:09\\nNice photo opportunity.

People are generally friendly. Vehicles have to pay a border tax to come in and out of the country. There is a price table on the wall.\\nThe village before Kyzyl Art Pass\\nThis almost abandoned village is the last Kyrgyz outpost before the actual physical border with Tajikistan. Some people actually live there year-round, and during the Summer months, you even have a guest house with available rooms.\\nKyzyl Art Pass 4,318 m\\nThis epic place is somehow a goal for many adventure travelers. The place itself is not special, although there a statue of a goat and a sign reminding where we are. The surrounding mountain views are fabulous though.\\nKyzylArt TJ border control 4,187 m\\nThe Tajik border is less developed than the Kyrgyz counterpart. People are much more friendly and welcoming also.\\nThe previous day\\nEvening\\nMorning\\nThe day started rather cold. The previous afternoon, I parked inside a ditch to protect ourselves from the evening winds. We woke up with the car and surroundings covered in snow.\\nDriving to the border\\nAfter breakfast, we drove 12 km along the Kyzyl Art river all the way to the Kyrgyz border post. We got there around 11 am.\\nThe Pamir Highway\\nThe famous road known as the M41 is a very inspiring challenge. The highway links Termez in Uzbekistan to Kara-Balta in Kyrgystan through Tajikistan. The 2,000-kilometer drive through the Pamir Mountain range has many dangerous sections, namely parts that recently suffered from earthquakes and landslides.\\nThe Pamir Highway was built between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the Soviet era in order to link the various zones integrated into the Soviet Republic.\\nIt is extremely not advisable to travel the Pamir Highway in times of severe rain or snow because even with good weather, you have to be very careful.\\nHowever, there are areas that are well paved, the road is always narrow and next to quite steep ravines. Mostly, the M41 is made of gravel and sand. This raw and breathtaking drive, despite its dangers (known as the road to hell), is open year-round. Check out my travel guide about the amazing places to visit in the Tajik Wakhan Corridor.\\nI was fortunate to drive the M41 in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region section three times already.

What do you want to find or what are you searching for while visiting other countries?\\nI never traveled until I was 21. Now I live to travel. I go to learn. I go to learn about how people live, how they interact, how they live differently and similarly to how people in my community live. I look for inspiration. I want to meet inspiring people and families. I look for beautiful places and landscapes that make me feel in awe of living on this planet.\\nMany travelers are strongly affected by previous journeys, certain people they met, the different cultures they encounter, and special experiences on the road. What is your most memorable trip and why? You can write about more than one trip if you wish.\\nDuring 2018 and 2019 I took a 14-month leave of absence from my teaching job and traveled to 100 of the more difficult countries in the world without returning home. The overall experience of visiting 39 countries in a row in Africa and obtaining visas along the way was an incredible test of patience and persistence.\\nI’d say that one of many memorable experiences during this journey was visiting Pakistan. I hitch-hiked across much of the northern part and almost never had to pay for anything. Locals were extremely kind and would invite me to stay with them and pay for all of my meals. I was a bit nervous about visiting Pakistan, given it doesn’t have the best reputation in my home country, however, I absolutely loved my time there and was treated with such warmth by the local people.\\nSome people need to be encouraged to leave home, to lose their fear of traveling. What advice can you give to someone who wants to start traveling but doesn’t know how, when and why?\\nWhy travel? It has completely changed my life and blown my mind by how beautiful this world is, yet how similar all people are at their core. Experiences are so much better than possessions.\\nWhen and how to travel? As soon as you can! Go to a neighboring country or a country where you have a friend of a friend. In the beginning, knowing someone in the country you are going to can make a big difference.\\nEven today, I love to have a local contact in the country I’m heading to. It eases the adjustment process when you arrive for the first time. I was very afraid and excited the first time I left my home country when I was 21 years old.\\nKnow that fear wants to limit what we can do in life. I want to live a life with no regrets because I didn’t let fear stop me from trying something! The first step of committing to go somewhere new is the hardest. Once you are abroad I fully believe you will not regret it!\\nHave you lived in a different country for more than six months? If so, where was it, and what were you doing there. Also, tell me what you learned from your experiences abroad.\\nI’ve lived abroad teaching English, translating, and working with NGOs in Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia, and Brazil. Living abroad is so much different than simply traveling abroad. By staying in one place you get past the honeymoon stage of everything being new and dive deep into the culture. You make more lasting relationships and you see how the country is from the inside out. I highly recommend living abroad!\\nChoosing a favorite landscape can be very difficult. But try to choose a landscape that will remain in your memory forever. What did you feel at that time?\\nI love the outdoors and have hiked trails and mountains all over the world. For me, the Himalayas stand out. I’ve spent large chunks of time in all the countries in the range and something about being among the tallest mountains in the world makes me feel in awe. The strength and kindness of the people who inhabit these communities also inspire me.\\nFollow Brian\\nBlog\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nYoutube\\nTwitter\\nDo you want to be interviewed?\\nWant to be included in my traveler’s interview archive?

       " ['Table of Contents\\nJapan Budget Accommodation\\nBudget and backpacker hotels in Japan are somehow easy to find but in the end, you don’t know which ones to choose. Most cities have very cheap hotels, but you might just give a bit more to avoid a total dump.\\nOn this page, I write step-by-step practical information, photos, and respective prices. Cheap hostels and hotels I stayed in Japan.\\nThis is the list of places I stayed during my 26-day trip to Japan (24 nights). I always got budget accommodation choices except in a few cities. Sometimes we had a cheaper hostel but far from the center and the transportation money for two people would compensate for getting a more expensive hotel after all. We could have spent much less as most cities have cheaper places to stay in. But taking into consideration quality, location and price we decided to alternate between hotels and hostels.\\nNote: I traveled to Japan with my sister. Taking into account that we could get a double room for almost the same price of two dorm beds in some good quality backpacker hostels, we decided to include some economy hotels with private rooms to our list of places to stay in Japan. During all our stay we spent 1502€ = 62.5€ per night. So, the final average price per person per night was 31€.\\nMy favorites\\nOn that previous trip, my TOP 5 accommodation in Japan were:\\nKumagai-ji Temple Lodging in Koyasan, let’s face it, sleeping in a real Buddhist temple and being able to participate in the morning ceremonies is priceless. Dinner and breakfast were also a unique experience. Although this place was not cheap, I totally recommend making an effort to stay here.\\n9 Hours Shinjuku-North Hostel in Tokyo, staying in a capsule hotel in Japan has to be in everyone’s bucket list while in Japan. Amazing views from the common area window.\\nKyoto Morris Hostel, very nice hostel with clean and useful facilities. Bunk beds were inside a huge space almost giving us the sense of being inside a little room all for ourselves.\\nRyokan Hodakaso Sanganoyu in Hirayu Onsen, the second most expensive accommodation I got in Japan. But again, mealtime was a unique cultural experience. What my sister and I paid for one private bedroom + dinner + breakfast would be the same as we would pay in a restaurant for the amount of food brought to us for dinner.\\nSuper Hotel Matsumoto Ekimae in Matsumoto, a practical and very well located hotel with a great breakfast and an amazing street from most of the bedrooms.\\nGeographic order of these hotels:\\nTokyo – Hakone – Hiroshima – Himeji – Kobe – Osaka – Koyasan – Nara – Kyoto – Kanazawa – Takayama – Hirayu Onsen – Matsumoto – Tokyo\\nBackpackers Hotels in Japan\\n9 Hours Shinjuku-North Hostel in Tokyo\\nI stayed for 1 night in this Tokyo hostel.

So, the final average price per person per night was 31€.\\nMy favorites\\nOn that previous trip, my TOP 5 accommodation in Japan were:\\nKumagai-ji Temple Lodging in Koyasan, let’s face it, sleeping in a real Buddhist temple and being able to participate in the morning ceremonies is priceless. Dinner and breakfast were also a unique experience. Although this place was not cheap, I totally recommend making an effort to stay here.\\n9 Hours Shinjuku-North Hostel in Tokyo, staying in a capsule hotel in Japan has to be in everyone’s bucket list while in Japan. Amazing views from the common area window.\\nKyoto Morris Hostel, very nice hostel with clean and useful facilities. Bunk beds were inside a huge space almost giving us the sense of being inside a little room all for ourselves.\\nRyokan Hodakaso Sanganoyu in Hirayu Onsen, the second most expensive accommodation I got in Japan. But again, mealtime was a unique cultural experience. What my sister and I paid for one private bedroom + dinner + breakfast would be the same as we would pay in a restaurant for the amount of food brought to us for dinner.\\nSuper Hotel Matsumoto Ekimae in Matsumoto, a practical and very well located hotel with a great breakfast and an amazing street from most of the bedrooms.\\nGeographic order of these hotels:\\nTokyo – Hakone – Hiroshima – Himeji – Kobe – Osaka – Koyasan – Nara – Kyoto – Kanazawa – Takayama – Hirayu Onsen – Matsumoto – Tokyo\\nBackpackers Hotels in Japan\\n9 Hours Shinjuku-North Hostel in Tokyo\\nI stayed for 1 night in this Tokyo hostel.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nJapan Budget Accommodation\\nBudget and backpacker hotels in Japan are somehow easy to find but in the end, you don’t know which ones to choose. Most cities have very cheap hotels, but you might just give a bit more to avoid a total dump.\\nOn this page, I write step-by-step practical information, photos, and respective prices. Cheap hostels and hotels I stayed in Japan.\\nThis is the list of places I stayed during my 26-day trip to Japan (24 nights). I always got budget accommodation choices except in a few cities. Sometimes we had a cheaper hostel but far from the center and the transportation money for two people would compensate for getting a more expensive hotel after all. We could have spent much less as most cities have cheaper places to stay in. But taking into consideration quality, location and price we decided to alternate between hotels and hostels.\\nNote: I traveled to Japan with my sister. Taking into account that we could get a double room for almost the same price of two dorm beds in some good quality backpacker hostels, we decided to include some economy hotels with private rooms to our list of places to stay in Japan. During all our stay we spent 1502€ = 62.5€ per night. So, the final average price per person per night was 31€.\\nMy favorites\\nOn that previous trip, my TOP 5 accommodation in Japan were:\\nKumagai-ji Temple Lodging in Koyasan, let’s face it, sleeping in a real Buddhist temple and being able to participate in the morning ceremonies is priceless. Dinner and breakfast were also a unique experience. Although this place was not cheap, I totally recommend making an effort to stay here.\\n9 Hours Shinjuku-North Hostel in Tokyo, staying in a capsule hotel in Japan has to be in everyone’s bucket list while in Japan. Amazing views from the common area window.\\nKyoto Morris Hostel, very nice hostel with clean and useful facilities. Bunk beds were inside a huge space almost giving us the sense of being inside a little room all for ourselves.\\nRyokan Hodakaso Sanganoyu in Hirayu Onsen, the second most expensive accommodation I got in Japan.

The thrill of exploring and the love for traveling made us save money in order to hit the road. Our main goal was to have a means of transportation that would give us the possibility of living inside.\\nThe best option was to get a vehicle that would give us total autonomy. After thinking, we considered several options: camping-car, motorhome, campervan, a pick-up truck with a camper top, or a four-wheel drive campervan. There were some factors we took into consideration. We were not exactly sure of what we wanted but knew what we didn’t want.\\nMercedes Sprinter campervan interior at Kyrgyz Ata National Park\\nOne of the most comfortable ways to travel is by campervan because you can stop and rest almost anywhere. You do not have to worry about hotel availability and bookings, and you always ensure the best place to walk down to the beach. Also, if you’re not happy with your neighbors, it will not be difficult to move and change to a better place. Of course, the whole van experience depends a little on the type of camper you have.\\nThere are several things to consider when choosing and buying a camper van. On this page, I share with you which are the most important things to consider, and some advice that I think will be crucial to give you ideas about this subject.\\nSprinter 4X4 Driving Icy Mountains in Kyrgyzstan 3,112 meters (10,210 feet)\\nHow to Buy a Van\\nAfter those initial essential requirements, and due to the 4WD axle, we reduced our vehicle brand options to the only accessible 4X4 vans on the market with these specifications.\\nOur requisites\\nCampervan, not RV or motorhome\\nLow profile van\\nEasy to drive\\nEasy to park\\nLow fuel consumption\\nNot older than the year 2000\\nFour-wheel drive (4WD/4X4)\\nHigh roof van model\\nNot taller than 3 m / 9.8 ft\\n10,000 Euros budget limit to buy a van\\n10,000 Euros budget to spend with the campervan conversion\\nAvailable 4X4 vans\\nPeugeot Boxer 4X4\\nIveco Daily 4X4\\nFiat Ducato 4X4\\nFord Transit AWD\\nVolkswagen Syncro 4X4\\nCitroen Jumper 4×4\\nMercedes Sprinter 4X4\\nHow to choose a 4×4 van\\nAfter analyzing all possible 4X4 van models, we started searching for possible deals on the internet and also went out to several car dealers specialized in cargo vans. We also analyzed that buying a minibus is considerably better than purchasing of a moving cargo van since minibusses take less load on a daily basis. So, our primary goal was to find 4X4 minibus somewhere in Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Luxemburg, Austria, The Netherlands, Belgium or Switzerland.\\nThe websites we used to find used vans were mobile.de, olx.pl, otomoto.pl, allegro.pl and sprzedajemy.pl. If you want to buy a vehicle in Europe, mobile.de is the best website since it gathers deals from different countries.\\nLater we decided to exclusively buy our van in Poland because of several important personal factors. Our prime choice was either Iveco Daily 4×4, Fiat Ducato 4×4 Dangel, or Mercedes Sprinter 4×4. Since these vans are difficult to find, we almost end up buying 2012, 5000 km / 3100 mi Ford Transit 125 T330 4X4 with Belgium plates. Since the Ford Transit 2.2 HDI engine is famous to have some particular malfunctions, we decided to wait and try harder to get better wheels.\\nCHOOSING A CAMPER VAN – 2012 FORD TRANSIT AWD\\nCutting the story short, after searching intensely for different car deals, and calling a few people we found on the Internet that was selling this type of vehicle, we found ours. My wife and I found our ‘ultimate’ travel and adventure vehicle!\\nAfter personally taking it to a short test-drive and a professional mechanical check-up we closed the deal. We got a 2005, 4X4 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2.7, 316CDI minibus with 160.000 km / 99.400 mi, belonging to a four-star hotel in the Polish mountains, bordering with Slovakia.\\nThis van is also known as Mercedes Sprinter T1N, and empowers a 2.7L 5-cylinder turbo-diesel engine with 154HP and 243 ft-lb torque. The truck was in excellent condition since it was used only during Winter, to transport clients from the hotel to the ski resort up in the hills.\\nPhoto Gallery of Sprinter 4X4\\nDIY camper van conversion\\nAfter approximately two months of DIY conversion, we ended up with the perfect camper van for our one-year trip around Central Asia and the Middle East.\\nLiving room into bed room\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Can’t ask me to choose what my heart falls for naturally.\\nInterview with Calvin D. Sun\\nWhat is your relation with traveling? What do you want to find or what are you searching for while visiting other countries?\\nWinter 2010. It’s 3am. My eyes open to an unfamiliar ceiling, and in the darkness I salvage the little of what’s left of my short term memory. I glance around: I think I’m in Cairo? Familiar memories slowly return proving that I’m not dreaming. The echoes of last evening’s call to prayer still remain fresh in my mind — What am I doing here?\\nFor the first 23 years of my life I never traveled. Except for an occasional trip with my father, I otherwise never desired or thought I would ever make efforts to leave home. Even worse, being a born and bred New York City native I had figured that the world would come to me anyway — what’s the point of spending all that money if I’m not going to live anywhere else but NYC?\\nIn 2006 my father died of a sudden heart attack and my mom was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. I was 19. And mired in hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt and with no job or any foreseeable sustainable source of income, I felt even less inclined to travel. It seemed I was destined to be confined to the shackles of my birthplace and again being that it was NYC, I reasoned I would be OK with that.\\nFor the next few years I was getting by with a few odd jobs and a handful of bartending gigs. Then in the winter of 2010, I jokingly made a bet with 2 friends that I would join them on their last minute trip to Egypt on the condition that roundtrip tickets would be less than $700. I was not serious at all: Flight prices were nearly triple that amount!\\nBut then I checked the prices on a whim a few hours later: $650. Roundtrip.\\nWithin less than 48 hours I woke up at 3am in an uncomfortable bed to an unfamiliar ceiling in Cairo.\\nWhat soon ensued afterwards was a series of unforeseen circumstances and comedy of errors that compelled the very same friends who I made the bet with to leave Egypt earlier than expected. So I ended up traveling solo the next 20 days without having planned to be alone. Although rough in the beginning, by the end of the 3rd week I couldn’t imagine having traveled any other way. I soon quit all my jobs and left for another 3 months, beginning the The Philippines and snaking my way to end in southern India.\\nIn other words: I was the last person you would have expected to travel. I was dragged kicking and screaming into this world and there’s a laughable sense of irony that I would be traveling as much as I am today.\\nAnd what am I searching for? The most honest answer is I don’t know. I have no plan. The tourist goes with an expectation in mind, and the traveler has none.\\nMany travelers are strongly affected by previous journeys, certain people they met, the different cultures they encounter, and special experiences on the road. What is your most memorable trip and why? You can write about more than one trip if you wish.\\nHow can you ask me to choose favorites among children? Family members? Loved ones? Here’s a list in no particular order:\\nEgypt – Riding on horseback by the Great Pyramids at sunrise, 36 hours after losing a bet to a girl I met at a bar in NYC (and as I ironically told her at the time would never see myself traveling)\\nBonus Egypt – Just went back 2 months ago taking 20 other people to do this very same thing (to celebrate 10 years of traveling!)\\nBonus #2 – And then there’s the White Desert\\nMauritania – Hitchhiking for a free ride on top of the “most extreme railway in the world,” aka the Iron Ore Train, across the Sahara underneath a sky full of stars (this was 3 weeks ago!)\\nNorth Korea – Sneaking onto the hidden 5th Floor and then my story exploding internationally\\nNauru – Celebrating New Year’s in the #1 least visited country in the world\\nMadagascar – Walking the Avenue of the Baobabs before sunrise\\nMyanmar – Hiking through the monsoon fog to see The Golden Rock at Kyaiktiyo\\nNamibia – Waking up at 4am in the morning to be the first one to catch the morning light at Dead Vlei\\nGreenland – Dancing the night away outside, underneath hours and hours of the Northern Lights\\nThe Philippines – Hiking up and down valleys with a girl I had just met just to see the legendary rice terraces of Batad\\nAntarctica – Streaking in Antarctica aka THE POLAR PLUNGE\\nJordan – Petra At Night\\nIndia – Witnessing the evening puri at Varanasi\\nIndia – Walking into the Golden Temple at Amritsar and being the only foreigner standing among a sea of worshippers\\nLithuania – Shisha at night with a local girl I had met at brunch in NYC 4 months prior who never could believe someone would travel to her home country\\nNew Zealand – Skydiving in the “adventure capital of the world” in Queenstown\\nSlovenia – A roadtrip through the entire country after kidnapping a random girl we met at our hostel (ok she insisted)\\nNicaragua – Sneaking up to the rooftop of our dingy hotel\\nUkraine – Gallivanting Kiev’s Nightlife to celebrate a random girl’s birthday\\nEast Timor – Swimming among bioluminescence without expecting it (completely unregulated)\\nSocotra Island – Camping underneath dragon blood trees.\\nRussia, Mongolia, China – The Trans-Siberian Railway with a group of strangers.\\nSome people need to be encouraged to leave home, to lose their fear of traveling. What advice can you give to someone who wants to start traveling but doesn’t know how, when and why?\\n“Momentum comes from pushing, not from planning. Confidence comes from scars and risk, not from indecision.” – Life Doesn’t Start Tomorrow. \\nIt starts with *you*. None of the following will ever matter unless you commit to your decision. Yes, dropping everything for something totally new and unknown can be scary! But nobody ever learned how to ride a bike by reading about it; you have to get on the damn thing! So get on and go! \\nYou might respond with “Yeah, but…” “’Yeah, but…’ is pernicious. Because it makes it sound like we have the best of intentions when really we are just too scared to do what we should. It allows us to be cowards, while sounding noble.” – 3 Reasons to Travel While You’re Young. \\nLet’s entertain the possibility that you’ll skip out. Then watch us as we come back safe and sound, share our stories, show you our photos, and talk about how our lives have changed. Whether or not you will realize it then, when you have your first child, when in your midlife crisis, or on your deathbed, you’re inevitably going to regret that you missed out on an epic once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This could set the tone for the rest of your life. Don’t let this happen. Starting slowly never ever works in travel and habits become harder to break once you’ve accustomed yourself to a way of approaching new experiences. \\nDo you think that to skydive you first have to look it up on Wikipedia, or learn to fall off a table? No. You simply jump. So those of you who want to travel, travel. And imagine how easy traveling will seem to you afterwards. Imagine how much confidence you’ll gain in yourself. Imagine the bragging rights and stories you’ll have when you come home. \\nNot many people realize that the opportunity for a tremendously positive life change is right in front of their faces: This could be the very moment where you turn your life around and finally do something *epic*. \\nThe world won’t wait for you.\\nHave you lived in a different country for more than six months? If so, where was it, and what were you doing there. Also, tell me what you learned from your experiences abroad.\\nNo, I have not lived in a different country for more than six months; NYC is a hard place to leave! The most was 3 months in Shanghai.\\nChoosing a favorite landscape can be very difficult. But try to choose a landscape that will remain in your memory forever. What did you feel at that time?\\nThe White Desert of Egypt: a moonscape formed by centuries of erosion and sandstorms and a last minute yet unanimously decided excursion for our last hurrah of the trip. \\nAnd I am alone. The desert gales wash my naked chest, and my bare feet burrow into the heat of the earth. I bathe in breathing moonlight. For a moment I can see God moving over the face of the sands.\\n \\nAnd I see only the desert.\\n \\nI feel a slight night shiver.\\n \\nIn the bareness of the desert I detach my consciousness and appreciate a reality in which I no longer exist; to forget that there is me. I consider the folly of qualifying the ego with an significance in this widespread sea of nothingness. It is a futile effort. \\n \\nI thus let go of ego, and instead perceive a world unadulterated by human consciousness. Unless an omnipotent deus ex machina arbitrarily dictates what is beautiful, the concept of objective beauty can be so ephemeral it might not even exist at all.\\n \\nAfter all, the world doesn’t care what you or I think is beautiful; we’re mere grains of sand in the desert. The world will keep turning, the desert winds will keep blowing, and time will go on all the same.\\n \\nWhat’s the point? \\nAnd yet the mere miracle of human existence offers us a simple gift to imagine the what is beautiful to each and every one of us. In the vast diversity of human consciousness, beauty will emerge out of relevance. Although we must share ideas that create an interdependent and collective consciousness of perceiving the world, the core rests in each of our individual experiences that engender infinite possibilities of what is beautiful. Like grains of sand in the desert.\\n \\nAnd in this beauty of relevance, we also learn that in the ultimate of the infinite there is no ultimate binary: No ultimate right and wrong, no ultimate black and white. The world never operated on a binary code of 0s and 1s, and neither must we. Some of us may choose to do so in order to devise convenient moral compasses, but the folly is when we impose that binary code — or even our standards of beauty — on others, or worse, the world. It is a futile effort.\\n \\nEspecially when in the end, the ego that imposes its values on others must one day confront the truth that its own existence is as fleeting as a single grain of sand in the desert. And the world will keep turning, the desert winds will keep blowing, and time will go on all the same.\\nFollow Calvin\\nBlog\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nYoutube\\nTwitter\\nDo you want to be interviewed?\\nWant to be included in my traveler’s interview archive?

During my one-year van life trip across Central Asia and the Middle East, I decided to return to this ancient country and visit some places where I haven’t been previously.\\n#Vanlife Iraq\\nFor a long time forgotten, Iraq is now a mysterious country since we don’t hear people speaking about traveling there that often (due to the lack of security). Before the American invasion of its territory, Iraq was safe and had thousands of western tourists visiting it every year.\\nUnfortunately, nowadays Iraq is a political mess and the presence of radical militant Islamic groups that took advantage of the political and security void, made the country a no-go destination for the most of its north and center territories.\\nCamper van in Iraq\\nCamper van in Iraq\\nMost of my camper van trip was in the Iraqi Kurdistan, although I also drove and visited places in the Khanaqin District and Kifri District of Diyala Governorate, and Tel Keppe District of Nineveh Governorate.\\nSome destinations on this page are located on disputed areas and under the control of the central government in Baghdad. Technically and by the Iraqi constitution, they don’t belong to the Kurdistan region, and are indeed controlled by the Iraqi Army and not by the Kurdish Peshmerga army. Because these regions are a kind of buffer zone, check-points are not as tight, and I was authorized to pass through driving my camper van. In some regions of Diyala, I was 15 km away from the line of fire against terrorist groups.\\nHow is Iraqi security situation nowadays?\\nAlong the road, dozens of checkpoints controlled by the Iraqi military or Kurdish Peshmerga try to maintain the country as safe as possible.\\nAll areas controlled by the Kurdish Peshmerga are almost totally safe, while other regions controlled by the Iraqi military lack some security due to the terrorist threat of militant Islamic groups still roaming the area.\\n144 km away from Baghdad in Khanaqin city\\nOne example is the city of Khanaqin, inside one of Iraq’s most dangerous regions (Diyala Governorate), where checkpoints are controlled by Iraqi forces. This city can be visited but it is a bit dangerous as recent news point out.\\nKhanaqin was one of the highlights of my trip due to the Arab / Kurd mix and also of its fascinating bridge and nearby mausoleums.\\nAlso read about when I visited Baghdad:\\nVisit Baghdad – City Adventure Guide to the Capital of Iraq\\nAny incidents or dangerous situations in Iraq?\\nSecurity problems\\nQiz Qapan Tombs parking lot in Iraq\\nQiz Qapan Tombs parking lot in Iraq\\nI actually only had one strange incident during the whole month.\\nIt was already pitch black outside in Qiz Qapan Tombs parking lot where I decided to spend the night.

They wanted to see our passports and told us the security situation in that specific area was very precarious.\\nThey were very worried about the situation.\\nWhile they were talking to us, there were some noises and voices up in the nearby caves, and for sure there were some people hiding in the rocks. They cut the conversation short and ran with their guns and flashlights.\\nArmy escort out of the mountains in Iraq\\nDuring an express evacuation of the premises, and going back to the main road at night, I heard some shots and they were pointing their flashlight and rifles into the fields.\\nWe were taken away to a safer place.

       " ['One month road trip in Kyrgyzstan with a 4X4 Camper Van\\nTraveling with a campervan is always rewarding in terms of personal experience. The liberty of being able to go whatever road you impulsively chose, sleep anywhere you want and decide the exact time when to leave a certain place, makes this type of travel a perfect fit for the independent-minded and spontaneous traveler.\\nAt this moment you should be asking yourself:\\n“Wait a minute, traveling TO Central Asia with a campervan?”\\nAnd my answer:\\nWell, yes, going from Europe and traveling around the Central Asian countries with a campervan is something perfectly possible and safe to do. Actually, Kyrgyzstan is one of the most open countries for tourists in the region, and most of the Western nations can enter Kyrgyzstan visa-free for up to 60 days.\\nDRIVING IN KYRGYZSTAN\\nNOTE: Everyone who knows me acknowledges the love I have for driving.

Stunning alpine lakes reflect a magnificent spectrum of color, and lush pine-covered foothills direct yurt-dwelling shepherds and yak herders. Beautiful description? Exactly! That is why I decided to visit Kyrgyzstan again.\\nVANLIFE (SARY-MOGHOL)\\nIt took me about 6000 km (3,739 mi) to finally get to Kyrgyzstan while crossing countries such as Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. I had been in Kyrgyzstan before, but not with a campervan, so this trip took a whole different level in terms of independent traveling.\\nUnique in its cultural richness and unmatched natural beauty, Kyrgyzstan has been home to a variety of cultures, empires, clans, and tribes among one of the lushest terrains in all of Central Asia. With an incredible display of rivers, waterfalls and nearly 2,000 lakes, its beautiful mountainous landscape has provided the setting for over two millennia of history.\\nVAN LIFE PHOTOS (KYRGYZ ATA NATIONAL PARK)\\nTraveling with a van makes it very easy to interact with local people since everyone is curious about a foreign car cruising around. I had tea and lunch invitations on a daily basis.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nThe Central Asia Rally – Adventure Race into History\\nHave you ever heard about a banger rally? Those crazy car rallies that cross a few countries while driving old or funny decorated vehicles? Well, I’m going to give you my personal insight into one of those unique road trips – the Central Asia Rally. Back in 2012, I participated in such a motoring event to go on a road trip adventure from Europe to the heart of the Silk Route.\\nAfter participating in the Caucasian Challenge Rally (crossing the Caucasus region at the border of Europe and Asia between the Black and the Caspian seas) a few years before, I ended up participating in another event of the same kind.\\nI invited my friend João Paulo Peixoto to be my travel partner. He has been to all the countries in the world so, for him, the thrill was the experience and not really visiting these countries again. Personally I also had been to all those countries before, so I was not expecting a touristic trip, rather a crazy adventure driving all the way from Central Europe to Central Asia.\\nCentral Asia Rally receives teams from England, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Norway, the USA, Canada, Hungary, etc.\\nNissan Primera 2.0 SLX model 2002 somewhere in the Uzbek desert\\nMy team partner João Paulo Peixoto\\nNOTE: The Central Asia Rally has changed its route since the time I participated. This article is based on my experience on a previous route.\\nItinerary\\nCountries of the 2012 rally\\nHungary – start in Budapest\\nUkraine\\nRussia\\nKazakhstan\\nUzbekistan\\nTajikistan – end in Dushanbe\\nCountries of the 2021 rally\\nRussia – start in Astrakhan\\nKazakhstan\\nUzbekistan\\nTajikistan\\nKyrgyzstan – end in Bishkek\\nCentral Asia Rally by a Finnish team\\nCentral Asia Rally 2014 by Finnish team\\nGeneral Information\\nThe Central Asia Rally mixes adventure, endurance, and navigation.\\nIt’s all about adventure since there are many unexpected factors and, based on the characteristics of the rally, there will be moments where you can count only on yourself or on your teammate. I got my car stuck in sand in the Uzbek desert when I was all alone, and our front car suspension broke on an isolated mountainous region of Tajikistan. Expect the unexpected.\\nIt’s all about endurance since there are long days and long distances. It can be exhausting at some point.\\nIt’s all about navigation as you need to find the right roads or trails in unknown areas, relying only on your paper map, some GPS coordinates, or the help of local people.\\nIf you finish this trip with your vehicle in one piece you can be proud of yourself. 5 countries, 14 days and 6500 km / 4038 mi through bad roads, desert tracks and river crossings – a real challenge for man and machine.\\n250 KM in 4 minutes\\nDriving to Ishkashim along the Afghanistan border in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in south-east Tajikistan.\\nGetting stuck in sand in Uzbekistan\\nWhile my team partner took the epic train – Bukhara Express – from Bukhara to Samarkand I was all alone for a supposedly easy desert drive along the Turkmenistan border. The chances of getting stuck in the sand while in Uzbekistan are not that high, unless you drive off-road. I got stuck in the sand when I decided to go in direction of Dengizkul lake.\\nThis is me waiting two hours in the desert until someone passes, lucky me…\\nI had to walk back to the desert tracks and after waiting two hours a truck finally passed by and tried to help me out. This heavy truck full of water also got stuck. So we had to wait one more hour until a tractor finally came in our rescue.\\nRead my page: Driving in Afghanistan\\nCentral Asia Rally on the news\\n“You buy an old car in Budapest and drive it 5,000 miles across Russia and the Stans, stopping only to pay the odd bribe. Welcome to the first Central Asia Rally”\\n“…One day I ride in car six, with Miguel Almas and Miguel Esteves from Portugal. In another world they are a vet and a psychiatrist; in this one they’re a pair of hard-drinking, hard-driving (though not always at the same time) desperados on a mission to experience everything they possibly can and to have a bloody good laugh while doing so. Their motto “Why not?” is perplexingly difficult to contradict, even when I really want to. Our drive in their red, 20-year-old VW Passat estate (185,000 miles on the clock) is supposed to be simple, but a few deliberate wrong turns, and a bit of off-roading later (“Why not?”) we find ourselves detained by the Uzbek military. After an hour of shared confusion, they send us on our way, but even though we are clearly in the wrong – we strayed into a military zone – they never hint at a bribe…”\\nBangers and cash: driving in the Central Asia Rally on The Guardian by Jamie Lafferty.\\nWarning\\nYes we towed the German team 4WD during more than 250 km / 155 mi\\nThe Central Asia Rally is long – both in time and distance. This can be stressful both physically and mentally. You have to be prepared for everything and you’d better think ahead. You cannot expect help from anyone else just besides yourself and your mates.\\nThings that might happen\\nthe need to come to a decision that can generate tension between you and your teammates.\\nhaving your vehicle with serious technical problems.\\ndriving all night because you got lost or you had to repair your vehicle.\\nhaving your car broke down or just get out of gear (literally).\\nto be stuck in the middle of nowhere, hungry and in need to solve your situation.\\nlosing your passport and you have no idea where.\\nhaving one of your teammates lost his passport and he knows he left it in a restaurant 200 km / 124 mi back.\\nhaven’t had a shower for a couple of days and there’s no hot water left in the hotel when you get there (or no water at all).\\ngetting stuck in the sand.\\nyour car dying in the river (like it happened to the rally organizer).\\ngetting stuck at the border without the necessary documents.\\nCar Rally Highlights\\n? Kazakhstan Uzbekistan border crossing\\nSpeed along the banks of the famed Volga River as you cross Russia.\\nContemplate divinity (and pray for navigable roads) in Kalmykia, Europe’s only Buddhist province.\\nExplore the ghost-ships of Kazakhstan, forever buried in the sand as the blistering deserts swallow the Aral Sea.\\nNavigate the crimson sands of Uzbekistan’s Kyzyl-Kum Desert, renowned for yielding magnificent dinosaur fossils.\\nWander the greatest ancient cities of the fabled Silk Road, including Samarkand and Bukhara (home to Marco Polo).\\nBrave the cruel twists & stunning peaks of the Pamir Highway – the world’s 2nd highest roadway – with portions of the drive above 4600 me / 15,000 ft.\\nPop into Afghanistan to visit bustling marketplaces that are kept unchanged in over a thousand years… and then pop right back out again before they even know you were there!\\nIt’s a hard road and an exhausting journey so be prepared to weather hardships that include cranky commissars, vodka-and-tea-fueled escapades, baking sun and withering cold, delectable native cuisines, frantic escapes through crowded border crossings, bizarre liquors of questionable provenance, rock slides, probably some brief nudity from your fellow adventurers, dust & sand, and some of the loveliest, most hospitable locals you will meet anywhere.\\nMap of Central Asia Rally 2021\\nMap Central Asia Rally\\nItinerary Central Asia Rally 2012\\nDay 1, May 26th\\nBudapest – Rivne\\nRoute: Budapest – M3 motorway – (Nyíregyháza) – Route 4 – Záhony – Chop – Lviv – Rivne\\nDistance: 790 km / 490 mi\\nDay 2, May 27th\\nRivne – Kharkov\\nRoute: Hotel Sofia – (Zhytomyr) – (Kiev) – (Poltava) – Visoky (Kharkov)\\nDistance: 800 km / 897 mi\\nDay 3, May 28th\\nKharkov – Volgograd\\nRoute: Visoky – Kharkov – Izyum – Krasnyi Luch – Novoshakhtinsk – Belaya Kalitva –\\nMorozovsk – Motel Tyhiy Don\\nDistance: 735 km / 456 mi\\nDay 4, May 29th\\nMotel Tyhiy Don – Astrakhan\\nRoute: Motel Tyhiy Don – Bereslavka – (Volgograd) – Akhtubinsk – Astrakhan\\nDistance: 530 km / 329 mi\\nDay 5, May 30th\\nAstrakhan – Beyneu\\nRoute: Astrakhan – Krasnyy Yar – Karaozek – Kotyayevka – Atyrau – Dossor – Kulsary – Beyneu\\nDistance: 840 km / 521 mi\\nDay 6, May 31st\\nBeyneu – Muynaq Camp\\nRoute: Beyneu – Akzhigit –– (Farhat’s café) – KC7 – Muynaq\\nDistance: 437 km / 271 mi\\nDay 7, June 1st\\nMuynaq Camp – Khiva\\nRoute: Muynaq – Kungrad – Khojayli – Nukus – Urgench – Khiva\\nDistance: 450 km / 279 mi\\nDay 8, June 2nd\\nKhiva – Bukhara\\nRoute: Khiva – Pitnak – Bukhara\\nDistance: 490 km / 304 mi\\nDay 9 – June 3rd\\nDistance: 0 km / 0 mi\\nREST DAY IN BUKHARA\\nDay 10 – June 4th\\nBukhara – Samarkand\\nRoute: Bukhara – Quarakol – Jumabazar – Desert drive – Pamuq – Mubarak – Quarshi –\\nSamarkand\\nDistance: 523 km / 324 mi\\nDay 11 – June 5th\\nSamarkand – Nurek\\nRoute: Samarkand – Shahrisabz – Ghuzar – Termiz – Sayrab – Baysun – Elbayan – Hazarbagh –\\nKhayrabad – Denau – Sofiyan – Dushanbe – Danghara – Vahdat – Nurek\\nDistance: 585 km / 363 mi\\nDay 12 – June 6th\\nNurek – Tavildara\\nRoute: Nurek – Naizirak – Vahdot – Ob-i-Garm – Sicharog – Lab-i-Jar – Kala-i-Naun – Tavildara\\nDistance: 210 km / 130 mi\\nDay 13 – June 7th\\nTavildara – Khorog\\nRoute: Tavildara – Saghirdasht – Kala-i-Khum – Rushan – Khorog\\nDistance: 280 km / 173 mi\\nDay 14 – June 8th\\nKhorog – Bulunkul Camp\\nRoute: Khorog – Jelondy – Pitob – M41 „Pamir Highway” Koytezek pass – Bulunkul (- Alishur)\\nDistance: 200 km / 124 mi\\nDay 15 – June 9th\\nBulunkul Camp – Murghab\\nRoute: Bulunkul Camp – Alishur – Murghab\\nDistance: 210 km / 130 mi\\nDay 16 – June 10th\\nMurghab – Ishkashim\\nRoute: Murghab – Khargush pass – Langar – Ishkashim\\nDistance: 345 km / 214 mi\\nBeware of landmines: The 1200 km / 745 mi long natural border with Afghanistan is the most dangerous zone of the rally. Most parts of the region are still not cleared of land mines. Never stray away from the main road and do not let yourself be tempted by the magnificent and refreshing streams, unless you see the “Cleared of Mines” sign somewhere between the main road and the river bank. Bathing kids and women washing clothes may be a good sign.\\nDay 17 – June 11th\\nIshkashim – Khostav\\nRoute: Ishkashim – Khala-i-Khum – Zigar – Khostav\\nDistance: 455 km / 282 mi with Afghan sightseeing\\nDay 18 – June 12th\\nKhostav – Dushanbe\\nRoute: Khostav – Kisht – Anjirob – Khulob – Vose – Dangara – Vahdat – Dushanbe\\nDistance: 285 km / 177 mi\\nCaucasian Challenge Rally 2008\\nMy video of the Caucasian Challenge – driving across the European Caucasus mountain region.\\nCaucasian Challenge Rally official website\\nWhat to Know\\nDriving in Central Asia\\nFor a tour of this length and with these characteristics you need to be well prepared physically and psychologically. Even if you are someone with an easy-going attitude.\\nVehicle check and proper maintenance is a key factor for your success. Doesn’t matter if your car is old, but it needs to be checked since 3000 km / 1864 mi out of the 6500 km / 4038 mi will be in extremely mountainous regions.\\nCar brakes, heating fan, and radiator need to be working properly. Get new car brake pads before you leave and pack the old ones along with you. You can change pads in bigger cities en route if you’re desperate. Riding up and down the mountains does make some cars have coolant boiling problems. If you have an older car, clean the radiator thoroughly and make sure the fan works properly.\\nExpect daily non-asphalt roads and river crossing.\\nThere is a repair shop in every inhabited place along with Central Asia.\\nTake two extra tires instead of one. If you want to be better off, take three spare tires. Use adequate tires for the trip in both quality and condition. There is absolutely no use taking huge mud tires, you can make the route with normal tires, the chance for mud is small, as you will travel mostly on rocky and sandy surfaces.\\nAlways keep extra water with you. Buy big 5 lt / 1.3 gal bottles of mineral water to store in the car along the trip. Better safe than sorry.\\nLearn the basics of the Russian language: greetings, basic expressions, and numbers. This will make you go along with police, border officials and local people all over Central Asia. Take a Cyrillic alphabet table along with you, as this will help you read road signs.\\nYou will need to face a lot of terrible roads so check your suspension. My car suspension broke down twice. Once in Uzbekistan and again in Tajikistan.\\nCheck the suspension and the springs. It is a top priority.\\nIf you’re not driving a 4WD, get a metal shield (sump guard) under the engine to protect it from the hit of bigger stones – just to be on the safe side.\\nTake at least one 20 lt / 5.2 gal jerrycan with you (two jerrycans are better if you have enough space), there might be fuel shortage in the Stans.\\nPump stations are not too frequent in the mountains. Furthermore, most of the cars (especially in Uzbekistan) run on CNG / natural gas, not LPG.\\nFrom Beyneu (KZ) to Denau (UZ) 80-octane or worse fuel is very common (if available at all). There are stages, even outside Uzbekistan, where you won’t find fuel stations and if you miscalculate your fuel consumption or forget to fill up your tank, you might be in trouble.\\nRemove the catalytic converter from your car if you are running on petrol. Bad quality petrol (that can be either low octane from petrol stations or stuff you buy at locals backyard from plastic buckets) can eventually kill your engine due to secondary consequences of fuel impurities.\\nYou might want to take extra air and petrol filter since you drive on dusty roads and petrol quality will be worse than what your engine got used to. Ask your mechanic what he recommends as spare parts for the trip.\\nQuick Tips\\nThe rally organizers – Travel Scientists can buy and prepare your car beforehand. I did it this way.\\nYou don’t really need to buy an old car. You can bring your new vehicle. Some people do actually bring their own car to the run and return back home with it.\\nIt’s better to have at least one person with you on the trip.\\nCheck out what kind of passport you hold since visas are necessary for all the countries in Central Asia.\\nI paid about €550 euros for my Nissan Primera. I spent a few hundred euros extra to prepare the car mechanically.\\nAfter the rally, my wife flew to Tajikistan and we continued traveling by car in the region for two more months.\\nI sold my car in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan for $1000 US dollars.\\nOur sponsors: Dar Rita, IESF, Auberge Café du Sud and Virtual Tourist.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nComposition in Photography\\nWhat’s composition in photography?\\nIt’s how a portion of the world our eyes see, is included and arranged in the restricted space of a photo.\\nBefore we move forward, I must make clear that in the art of photography we must be careful with strict rules. On this page, I will help you improve your photo composition skills with twenty important photography composition rules you need to know.\\nMain questions related to the art of composition in photography:\\nWhat do we leave out?\\nDo we want to highlight a specific object or do we want to include as many elements in the photo as possible, without any order?\\nAnd how do we arrange them?\\nHow do we cut out those elements that will take our audience’s eyes away from what we want to focus on?\\nMost of the principles of photo composition have been used for hundreds of years in different art forms. But what matters is what the traveler wanted to show or record at the time they shot.\\nSometimes is a personal and intimate photo, something the photographer took for himself, without worrying about how his audience will take it.\\nOther times, you want to make art, freely and unhinged, to get something creative or kind of crazy.  \\nHowever, if you want to please as many people as you can, cater to an audience, think about the public success of a photo, then, in that case, it’s best if you use some methods and techniques that one way or the other will contribute to please whoever sees the picture later.\\nComposition Rules You Need To Know:\\nThe Rule of Thirds\\nClean Margins\\nIn Symmetry, the Center\\nFrom Left to Right\\nKeep it Simple\\nUse Light as a Pointer\\nBetween Even and Odds… Choose Odds\\nTriangle Instead of Square\\nClose-Ups\\nSense of Scale\\nA Frame Inside a Frame\\nLines that Lead the Eye\\nFill in the Photo or Not, That is the Question\\nPairing Objects\\nPhoto Balance\\nRule of Space\\nIsolating the Object\\nWith or without people?\\nAlternative Perspectives\\nPlaying with Colors\\nPhotography Composition Rules\\nPhotography Composition Rules\\n1. The Rule of Thirds\\nThis is the most famous rule of composition but, like any other one of the rules, it’s not meant to be followed blindly. Only if you want, and if your intuition and experience over time tell you you should.\\nIt means splitting the image into nine areas of similar size. Three lines and three columns. You can do it in your mind, but most cameras have a grid option on the screen that helps you visualize the composition space.\\nThe point is to place the focal elements of the photograph on the lines or, even better, on where the lines intersect. The rule of thirds helps us dodge the natural inclination to place our focal point of the image right in the center, which doesn’t work as well as we’d thought.\\nIt’s a logical assumption. Shouldn’t the focal point of our composition be in the center? But in fact, composing the image like that diminishes the overall impact, and we end up devaluing what we wanted to highlight. You should put the focal point on where the lines intersect, preferably on the right side as we’ll see soon.\\nUnder this rule, we’ll also try to align the horizon with one of the two longitudinal lines of the thirds. But, of course, this is just a general guideline that may or may not work in the specific context of a photo. Again, take these rules with a grain of salt.\\n2. Clean Margins\\nThis is one of the cases when this is an actual rule and not just an idea or a technique: it is crucial that you keep the margins of a photograph clean of loose and distractive elements.\\nAnything that disturbs the visual harmony in the margins of our composition will distract whoever sees the image and thus remove the spotlight from the element we wanted to focus on.\\nSome mistakes are easily avoided. We obviously would never leave half of a person in the background of an image, close to the composition margin. But sometimes we leave things behind that aren’t so obvious. These are very easy slips precisely because we’re focusing all of our attention on the center of the composition. It’s important to let go of that natural urge and pay attention to what’s happening near the margins. We don’t want to cut out anything, and we don’t want to break the flow of lines, we don’t want any elements that are visually distracting. We want a clean, neutral margin.\\nOn the other hand, these are the easiest mistakes to correct when editing a photo. All you need to do is crop here and there, and you’ll have the perfect framing.\\n3. In Symmetry, the Center\\nI already told you that there’s nothing strict or fixed about rules. I just told you about the rule of thirds and the importance of fighting the urge to put our focal point in the center of the picture, and here I am contradicting myself. If it works in a particular scenario, centering could work, of course. Symmetries are one of those situations, that split the image in two, from an imaginary line in the middle. Where there are sharp lines, you’ll probably find exciting solutions that focus in the center, such as photographing architecture or roads.\\n4. From Left to Right\\nOur mind processes the visual information from our eyes from left to right. It’s a habit that comes from reading, at least on the Western side of the world because in other cultures it would be different. That’s why we should always try to keep the focal point of our photo on the right side.\\nSo what happens when we’re looking at a picture? Our eyes will start visualizing the image from the left side, and when we find the focal point of the photography, there’s a sense of accomplishment. It helps a photo to have an impact!\\nOn the other hand, if we keep the focal point on the left side, our mind quickly absorbs what matters and moves on looking for more visually relevant information, when it doesn’t find it, observing that image ends with a slight sense of frustration.\\nAn excellent way to test this principle is mirroring a photo with a photo editing software and looking at the results. I bet you the reader will be more pleased by the same picture if the focal point of the image is on the right side.\\n5. Keep it Simple\\nTry to keep the scene you’re capturing as simple as possible. The more information our mind has to process when we look at a photo, the less impact the image will have. Why give visual information that’s irrelevant or even counter-productive? With this in mind, look for subtle backgrounds and compose the image in a way you’ll exclude as much as possible the elements that aren’t part of the story you’re trying to tell.\\n6. Use Light as a Pointer\\nLight attracts attention. When looking at a photo, our eyes tend to look for the area where there’s light. You can use this to increase the highlight on the primary target of the photograph. It’s not always feasible, of course. Unless we’re using special equipment to manipulate light, which won’t happen when we’re traveling, we’ll have to do our best to work with the conditions around us. Observe the rays of light that penetrate a darker environment, like a house or a part of the woods, and find out where they’ll fall. We’ll never know if we’ll find a unique opportunity.\\n7. Between Even and Odds… Choose Odds\\nFor some reason, the asymmetry of an odd number of elements seems to have a more significant impact on a picture. When you’re creating your photo composition, opt for an odd number as much as possible. Whether it’s a portray of a person or the picture of the towers of a castle, cars in a race. Anything.\\n8. Triangle Instead of Square\\nIf you can control the elements of a photo during composition, opt to frame them in an imaginary triangle shape instead of a square or a triangle. Do you need an example? Think of the classic group photo. Let go of the traditional pattern of lining up people on one row in the bottom, then another one, and one more in the end with the tallest people. It’s a very classic format, right? So next time you photograph a group of people, try to line them up following an irregular pattern, preferably a triangle. You’ll see the result is not only refreshing, but it will catch the attention of people who see the photo.\\n9. Close-Ups\\nA close-up shot is a trick that works well to give life to an image and give the photo a tridimensional. This composition technique creates a forward focal point that serves as a guideline and provides depth to the rest of the picture. This solution works particularly well with wide angle lenses.\\n10. Sense of Scale\\nSome scenarios lose meaning without references to establish their dimension. Some of the most common cases happen when photographing elements of different sizes. An example? A dune. Out of context, a dune can be a tiny pile of sand or a mountain. The absence of scale confuses us because, in reality, a dune is a dune and we can only tell them apart based on size. The same thing happens with a waterfall or a rock formation. The photographer can and should consider all this to get results. We can turn something small into something big, and something big into something small. It’s the magic of photography. But if we want to give a precise idea of these objects, we must include something in the composition that raises no doubt about the size. It could be a person or a fixed size object. To show how small an insect is, for example, we can place a spoon, a bottle cap, a pen. To showcase how big a cliff or a beach is, we can include people, a car, a house.\\n11. A Frame Inside a Frame\\nIt’s easier to imagine a photo like a frame. A frame where we can include the world we’re observing at that magic moment we shoot. Inside it’s like a painting. It’s a real frame, then. A composition that works well is to find another structure, an element that limits the space we want to show, that catches the attention of the person seeing the picture. Some examples of frames include windows, arches, niches in castle walls, or even natural elements like tree trunks or caves.\\n12. Lines that Lead the Eye\\nWith this composition technique, the photographer will use geometric lines to lead the photo observer to the focal point he wants to highlight. These lines don’t have to be straight, although this is the most common shape used by photographers. If you manage to structure your composition using a line that’s not straight, congratulations! It’s not an easy task, and the result is usually outstanding. Although this is a technique based on lines as a tool, the photographer can turn them into the main subject of the image.\\n13. Fill in the Photo or Not, That is the Question\\nIn the scope of photo composition, this is one of the most contradictory questions. The right answer falls on the photographer’s personal decision and how he reads the scene. On the one hand, if you fill the photograph with the focal point, we make sure the person seeing the picture focuses on what really matters. Be it a person, an animal, or a structure, by completing filling the space with our subject, even if we have to sacrifice parts of it, we are giving it the maximum exposure. But sometimes it pays off to provide the viewer with what we call negative space, like the ocean or the sky or even a blurred background. Anything that’s not too detailed or too distracting. In this case, although our main subject doesn’t fill in the image entirely, the negative space highlights it. It’s as if the eyes of the viewer focus on the only element that stands out, catching their attention.\\n14. Pairing Objects\\nSome people call this composition technique juxtaposition because it consists of including two main subjects in the same photo. But don’t take it literally, it doesn’t always mean placing one over the other in the same picture.\\nThis composition method follows two opposing variations. One of the options is to include contrasting elements, such as old and new, classic and innovative, big and small, rich and poor. Any of these or other combinations work well capturing the viewer’s attention, piquing their curiosity and leading them to take a closer look, capturing unique moments, places, or events. On the opposite side, juxtaposing similar elements also creates exciting results. When using this method, it enhances certain elements that interconnect naturally.\\nLet’s picture a scene in Havana, Cuba. An old American 1960s Chevrolet, its driver with a cigar on the corner of his mouth leans against the car. Behind him, at avenue Malécon, there are two buildings, one of them built in the 1930s neglected and crumbling. Next to it, a new building, a small four-stories hotel. In this context, the photographer can choose which juxtaposition method he’ll use to get a unique photo. If he moves one way, he’ll photograph the car and the man with the old building behind, connection elements that complement one another and taking the viewer into a journey through time. If he takes a few steps in the opposite direction, he’ll create a contrast between the classic car and the driver that represent the past and the modern building, showcasing Havana as a city of contrasts.\\n15. Photo Balance\\nAlthough the rule of thirds is the best-known composition technique, sometimes resorting to it doesn’t make a satisfactory image, creating unwanted spaces that become an eyesore.\\nIf we focus on an interesting subject and place it on the left side, we can create a space that’s too wide and unpleasant to the eye as we move our gaze to the right side. The solution is to find a secondary subject that balances the picture without diverting the focus from the central element.\\n16. Rule of Space\\nThis an important rule, vital even, to use in photos of moving objects. In these cases, you must leave enough room to allow the viewer to see the object moving mentally. When photographing people, you should still consider using this technique even if there’s no movement. Usually, photos are better if there’s enough space towards the main subject the viewer must look at. Or towards the side the person is facing.\\n17. Isolating the Object\\nI don’t know if I should include this technique in the chapter about composition because it has nothing to do with placing certain elements in the photo. It’s about using optical methods, specifically manipulation of depth for a more vibrant result.\\nThe goal here is to make an object stand out, especially if the background is visually confusing and disturbs the importance of our central element. In that case, if we can blur everything else, reducing the depth, we’ll highlight what we want keeping the viewer’s attention exactly where we want it to be.\\n18. With or without people?\\nThis is a common situation when we travel. For example, we come across a beautiful street with amazing houses and our first reaction is to try to get a picture without people in it. People don’t fit in the image that caught our attention, so we tend to exclude them from the scene we’re about to photograph. Most of the times this is a mistake, and the result would be better if we let those people be part of our photo. People give the background a sense of scale, a natural feel, and they’re picturesque themselves most of the times. When in doubt, I advise you to take at least two pictures of the same place, one with people and one without.\\n19. Alternative Perspectives\\nThis is a fundamental technique! Usually, we all see the world from the same perspective — some lower, some higher. But the human universe was thought and built in a way that we all see things the same way. Traffic lights, billboards. They all mean something to the human eye. Because people who are used to a particular embedded visual order, a photograph that challenges that habit immediately creates an impact and catches the attention of the viewer.\\nThis is a technique based on the photographer’s ability to revolutionize, to innovate how we see the world, by creating new, surprising angles.\\n20. Playing with Colors\\nCertain color combinations work well, others not so much. Designers and other professionals who work with color combinations have been using a tool called “color wheel” for a long time. This wheel includes all the colors, and those that work better together are in opposing ends of the wheel. We can see which colors work better together at a glance. And that matters in color photography, or most of the photography that’s done these days.\\nIf we use the “wheel,” we can quickly pinpoint scenarios that will come out well in a photo because certain complementing colors prevail.\\nWhat NOT to do in Photo Composition\\nDon’t crop out body parts, of humans or animals. If you don’t have a choice, don’t crop them at the joints. If you’re doing a portrait with a close-up, of course, you’re going to have to isolate the person’s head or bust, but don’t crop blindly.\\nDon’t forget to observe what’s around the photo. People tend to focus on the central area, and when they see the result, most times at the end of the day when they get home, they’ll realize they included distracting elements because they didn’t pay attention to what was happening in the margins.\\nDon’t crook the images, keep them in line with the horizon. It’s true that you can straighten it later using software, but that could mean you’ll lose essential elements and it’s best to do it right at first.\\nFinal Words on Composition\\nI’ll have to repeat myself: no composition rule is actually a rule. Nothing is mandatory. Photographing is an art and innovating is allowed, recommended even. Travel photography isn’t any different, nor it has specific composition techniques. The several methods I mentioned are ideas that the travel photographer can use or not. More than rules, they’re techniques, tools that the photographer can use to get more compelling pictures.\\nA suggestion: after reading about all these composition techniques, take a look at some of the well-known photographers and try to identify how they implement those techniques in their work. You’ll be surprised with how quickly you can identify the formulas they made their photos so special.\\nIn the meantime, when you go out in the world to implement these methods, be patient if the first results are not what you expect. Give it time. I suggest you focus on one or two techniques and try to use them in the environment around you. And remember you can always edit the images, deleting superficial areas and redefining the framing.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['VISIT OMAN\\nThe Sultanate of Oman is a fascinating country located on the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Oman is a mysterious nation since we don’t hear people speaking about it very often.\\nIt is quite easy to visit Oman because it’s very safe and full of very friendly and hospitable people.\\nOn this page, I make a list of 25 Amazing Places which are undoubtedly the country’s major tourist attractions.\\nBest places to visit in Oman\\nTop 25 places to visit in Oman.\\n1. Ras Musandam Fjords\\nVisit Ras Musandam Fjords – Visit Oman\\nRas Musandam peninsula is separated from the rest of the country. It is famous for its breathtaking fjords of desert mountains and waters of a beautiful shade of blue.\\nIn Oman, they still resort to the dhow, a traditional sailboat, for transportation but for fishing and tourism instead of for commercial trade as it was done in the past. It’s quite usual to see these boats along the coast. You’ll find a big fleet on the ports of Sohar, Salalah, and Muscat, as well as Sur, where the biggest boat manufacturing center is based.\\nQuick facts about Musandam:\\nA governorate of Oman\\nLocated on the Musandam peninsula\\nIs an exclave, separated from the rest of the country\\nKumzari is the language around Kumzar\\nThere is a fast ferry service between Musandam and Muscat\\nFour provinces: Khasab, Bukha, Dibba Al-Baya, and Madha\\nKhasab is the capital city of Musandam\\nThe Musandam Peninsula is sinking\\nFrequently called the “Norway of Arabia”\\nPortuguese built Khasab at the beginning of the 17th century\\nTelegraph Island, abandoned in the mid-1870s is a reminder of the British Empire\\nRead my page: Visit Ras Musandam – The forgotten peninsula of Oman.\\n2. Khasab Fortress\\nVisit Khasab Fortress\\nThe capital of the region called Ras Musandam is the city of Khasab and is more accessible coming from the United Arab Emirates.

Masirah Island\\nVisit Masirah Island Beaches\\nMasirah Island is a desolate and deserted destination. If you like having the feeling of being in the middle of nowhere, and in a place where hardly anyone goes, then you’ll love this island off the coast of the Indian Ocean. There are several deserted beaches where you can see turtles laying eggs.\\nQuick facts about Masirah Island:\\nBiggest settlement is Ras-Hilf\\nLocated on the coast of Oman, in the Indian Ocean\\nLocation of a major air base for the Oman Air Force\\nMany shipwrecks along the remote stunning beaches\\nLocated 18km distance from the mainland\\nMasirah Island is one of the eleven provinces of Oman\\nThe island is about 95 kilometers long and 14 kilometers wide\\nRead my page: Masirah – a desolated island on the coast of Oman.\\n5. Jebel Akhdar Mountain\\nVisit Jebel Akhdar Mountain\\nCrossing the Jebel Akhdar was one of the best moments of my Oman trip. I drove up departing from Al Hamra until Ar Rustaq, on the other side of the mountain. These tracks are to be made with a 4wd, but I drove a regular city car. If by chance you also do it (I mean, without a 4WD), I advise you to drive very carefully. Landscapes are amazing. Everything is breathtaking.\\nQuick facts about Jebel Akhdar:\\nIts name means “the Green Mountain”\\nJebel Akhdar is part of the Al Hajar Mountains range\\nJebel Shams is he highest point 3,000 metres/9,800 feet high\\nIt extends about 300 km/186 mi northwest to southeast\\nMostly inhabited by the Bani Riyam, an ancient Arab tribe\\nNewly stablished as the “Jebel Akhdar Sanctuary for Natural Sceneries”\\n6000-year-old rock art sites can be found in the mountains\\n6. Tomb of Job\\nVisit Tomb of Job religious complex\\nJob is a biblical character, from the Book of Job of the Old Testament. In this place, one can visit his tomb, and in the outer zone is a small box where there’s his footprint (it’s a huge foot mark, but that’s what people say). The whole area is a complex of Muslim pilgrimage.\\nIn Islam, Job is considered a prophet, and his name is known in Arabic as Ayoub. This site is located on the mountain in Salalah region.\\nWhile you visit Oman, you will notice that the country’s culture is based on Islam, although it developed its own sub-culture from this religious doctrine, called Ibadism. Sunni and Shiism are also practiced in the region.\\nQuick facts about Job:\\nJob is the main figure of the Bible’s Book of Job\\nJob is a prophet in the Abrahamic religions\\n7. Taqah Castle in Mirbat\\nVisit Taqah Castle in Mirbat\\nTaqah Castle dates back from the nineteenth century and is situated at the entrance of Mirbat. It was built to be the permanent residence of Sheikh Ali bin Al Ma’shani Timman. Very well preserved, this castle has an interesting ethnographic museum, showing various aspects of life and culture from the region.\\nQuick facts about Taqah:\\nWell-preserved castle built in the 19th-century\\nTaqah is a coastal town in the Dhofar governorate\\nShaikh Al-Afeef is the name of Taqah mosque\\nTaqah grew as an exporter port of myrrh\\nFishing and agriculture are the main resources of the population\\nTaqah has two forts, one of which has been restored.\\nMazoon al-Mashani, the mother of the current Sultan Qabus ibn Said, is a native of this region\\n8. Shisr – ruins of the lost city of Ubar\\nVisit Shisr – ruins of the lost city of Ubar\\nShisr archaeological ruins are not exactly the most spectacular I’ve ever visited because there is not much to see. But it’s difficult to get there. You have to drive through desert tracks and arrive at an isolated village. You will notice camels, goats, and walls written with “the Lost City of Ubar” phrase. It’s exotic enough for me to have enjoyed going to this historic site. At the end of the village, there is a small farm with lots of animals, including several camels you can make friends with.\\nQuick facts about Shisr:\\nThe most common being names given to this city are Ubar, Wabar and Iram\\nNicholas Clapp claimed that Shisr is the site of Ubar, mentioned in the Quran\\n9. Sumhuram ruins\\nVisit Sumhuram ruins\\nThe ancient port of Sumhuran dates from the third century BC to the fifth century AD. This is one of the most important places of the region’s pre-Islamic time. This was one of the great centers of Frankincense production of South Arabia. The ruins are spectacular, with the amazing surrounding scenery.\\nQuick facts about Sumhuran:\\nSumhuran is also known as Khor Rori\\nKhor Rori is an Early South Arabian archaeological site near Salalah\\nThe small fortified town was founded around the 1st century CE\\nKhor Rori was an outpost for the kingdom of Ḥaḑramawt\\nSumhuram was discovered by James Theodore Bent in the late 19th century\\n10. Al-Baleed ruins\\nVisit Al-Baleed ruins\\nAl-Baleed ruins are a huge archaeological complex on the coast, near the city of Salalah. Ibn Batuta visited this site in 1329 and reported its beauty. Most of the buildings of the citadel would be built in a typical architectural style of the region of Dhofar, mixing wood and stone.\\nQuick facts about Al-Baleed:\\nAl-Baleed it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site\\nThere is also a museum there called Frankincense Land Museum\\nAncient Middle Age settlement al-Baleed, named from al Balad, meaning town\\nAl Baleed was a settlement during the Iron Age\\nFounded in the 11th century AD, it became a frankincense trade commerce centre\\n11. Samail Castle\\nVisit Samail Castle\\nSamail Castle was undoubtedly the most beautiful castle I visited in Oman. The Samail Hosn, or Samail Castle, is surrounded by mountains and huge palm trees. A real oasis in the desert mountains. A few kilometers before Samail there is another small fort. This is known for its watchtowers which overlook the entire valley.\\n12. Incense Markets in Salalah\\nVisit Incense Markets in Salalah\\nSalalah is a city of great importance in the trade of frankincense. Here, there are two markets with shops selling incense and good quality products made from resin. I bought 4 kg and sent it home by mail. It still burns and smells great. Salalah also has a beach area that you can visit and the huge mosque of Sultan Qaboos (ask to visit the interior of the mosque).\\n13. Telegraph Island\\nVisit Telegraph Island\\nTelegraph Island is a small piece of land in the middle of the Musandam Peninsula’s waters. In the nineteenth century, there was a station here. It used to boost the British telegraph messages along the Persian Gulf cable line, which was part of the London – Karachi telegraph wire. Nowadays there are only a few non-interesting ruins, but the place is very nice to do snorkeling.\\n14. Nizwa\\nVisit Nizwa old city and castle\\nNizwa is one of my favorite cities in Oman. It has many places to visit such as the animal and vegetable market, the castle with old Portuguese cannons, the potteries, and the old town. The view from the top of the castle is fantastic. In Nizwa you can also visit the famous Falaj canal system. It supplies water to the oasis listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site.\\nRead my page: Visit Nizwa Oman • 8 best places & top things to do.\\n15. Village Haat\\nVisit Village Haat in Jebel Akhdar Mountains\\nHaat is a village lost in the mountains of Jebel Akhdar Mountains. Here, several stone houses are protected by palm trees. There is a small river, falaj irrigation system, and a water tank. It is protected with an AK-47 by a member of the village which is always present. There is also a small pool of natural water coming from a mountain spring. The children are very friendly and can “play” with the goats.\\n16. Jabrin Castle\\nVisit Jabrin Castle\\nJabrin Castle is an excellent example of military architecture in the region. It was built by Imam Sultan bin Saif Al Ya’arubi in 1670. Exploring the interior of this massive castle is fantastic. You can enjoy the views from the top of the tower and also discover the fabulous ceilings of many rooms and halls inside.\\n17. Bahla Fortress\\nVisit Bahla Fortress\\nBahla Fortress is one of the historical forts near the Djebel Akhdar. The castle dates from the thirteenth century and is well-preserved after being closed for renovation for several years. This building is surrounded by an oasis with some fantastic views. This place is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\\n18. Al Hazm\\nVisit Al Hazm castle and village\\nAl Hazm is a place with lots of history. Al Hazm has a large fortress and various ruins of an old village. It even has an ancient tomb at the top of the hill. The scenery is charming, mixing green palm trees and desert mountains.\\n19. Sadah Coast\\nVisit Sadah Coast and desert mountains\\nDriving to Sadah Coast is fantastic. The landscapes are amazing and of unique beauty. Sadah is a small village by the sea. The surrounding mountains are made of black rock and “invaded” by sand from the beach.\\n20. Dunes of Ramlat as Sahmah\\nVisit Dunes of Ramlat as Sahmah\\nThe Dunes of Ramlat the Sahmah are basically the end of the Great Desert of Rub Al Khali in Saudi Arabia. Here, orange dunes of fine sand delight desert lovers like me. You can climb to the top and enjoy the fantastic views.\\n21. Oil wells in Fahud\\nVisit Oil wells in Fahud\\nFahud is a major oil center of Oman. In the desert, there are large infrastructures to extract oil and gas. The combination of towers and pipelines make this environment a bit surreal. To get here, you need to drive into the desert on a dirt road. At one point I found out that it was forbidden to be there, so I ended up with a military escort during 30 kilometers.\\n22. Omani Family Homestay\\nOmani Homestay\\nTo be received by an Omani family is a unique experience because these people are very friendly and excellent hosts. I was offered a lot of food and, to my big surprise, they gave me a set of traditional clothes and a turban. When someone invites you home to drink tea, coffee or eat… accept the invitation.\\nTraditionally, men wear the dishdashi, an ankle-length collarless robe, with long sleeves, usually white. The muzzar turban is also a necessary accessory. Women wear sirwal (pants) and a lihaf (head scarf). The most important event is, of course, Ramadan, the month dedicated to fasting.\\n23. Rima Petrostation\\nVisit Rima Petrostation\\nThe landscape in Rima is dry with desert mountains and a large valley of huge cliffs. There is a large oil field with machines that operate 24 hours a day to get the “black gold” from the earth. The sound of these machines is strangely attractive.\\n24. Abandoned boats in Ras-Hilf\\nVisit Abandoned boats in Ras-Hilf\\nRas-Hilf is the capital of Masirah island. Although the city itself does not have much interest, its beaches with many shipwrecks are always a beautiful “landscape” to enjoy and take pictures. You can also go up the abandoned boats.\\n25. Chasing crabs on Ras Madrakah beach\\nChasing crabs on Ras Madrakah beach\\nBeach landscapes in Ras Madrakah are quite beautiful. Thousands of crabs make from the wild beach their territory, and it’s amusing running after them towards the water. However, they do not let themselves get caught… It’s wonderful to hear the symphony of waves, running back and forth with Nature.\\nRead my page: Driving in Oman – Muscat to Salalah Road Trip – 15 Days/3000 km.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nCoworking & Coliving Morocco\\nTraveling forever while making a living as a freelancer on the road. That is the dream life for many people, especially the younger generations.\\nPeople who feel stuck and limited by a monotonous and routine life, repeating the same tasks every day and who dream of a different kind of work, one with flexible hours that allows them to work from anywhere in the world.\\nThe growth and accessibility of the internet turned what was nothing but a dream a couple of decades ago into a reality. The first people to enjoy a nomad life had remote jobs, typically in the creative and technological fields. Writers, web designers, online shop owners. All they needed to do their job was an internet connection and a computer.\\n© Sundesk\\nOver time, this became possible for more people. The internet was more accessible and easier to use, which meant people didn’t need to have high technical skills to embrace this lifestyle and the number of businesses and jobs that could be done remotely grew.\\nA few years ago, the first coworking spaces appeared. Those were places for freelancers or employees who worked remotely, where space and work conditions were optimized with comfortable chairs and desks, leisure areas, all the technology needed, a bright and inspirational décor, lots of light and complimentary drinks.\\nPeople who use these spaces aren’t nomads necessarily. In many cases, they are freelancers who used to work from home but began to use coworking spaces to improve their productivity and minimize distractions.\\n© Dar Digital Nomad\\nMany freelancers realized they could work while they traveled, and many adopted a nomad lifestyle, moving from one place to the next while temporarily staying in nice places that offered a balance between leisure and productivity.\\nDream destinations like the Greek islands, Bali, or the Philippines with reasonable internet access, affordable, and with good quality of life began to be sought out by these people and the expression digital nomad was born.\\nThat’s how someone thought about creating coliving spaces in addition to the existing common coworking spaces. Digital nomads could live in those places for as long as they wanted and enjoy excellent working conditions for these traveling freelancers, which included an area for coworking and living, shared or not. These living arrangements create small communities of people with the same lifestyle and interests.\\nMap of All Coworking Spaces in Morocco\\nTraveling and Working in Morocco\\nColiving & Coworking Spaces at the Pearl of North Africa\\nMorocco is the perfect country for the modern digital nomad. The weather is mild for most of the year, local culture is exotic, there is plenty of easy-to-use public transportation, there are great beaches, great people, and good food, cost of living is low, it’s a safe country, politically stable, and very accessible. All alluring factors for people who work while traveling.\\nHere you’ll find a great base, with good options when it comes to a coworking space in Morocco and with a few options too when it comes to a coliving lifestyle. So why not spend a few months exploring Morocco while working and enjoying the optimized working conditions to increase productivity?\\nThere are several coworking spaces in Morocco, over a dozen in some cities like Casablanca. Also, the first coliving spaces began to emerge and were enthusiastically welcomed by the digital nomad community.\\nHere is a list for the best coliving and coworking spaces in Morocco.\\nColiving Spaces in Ouarzazate\\nCoworking and Coliving Spaces in Ouarzazate\\nThis quiet city is strategically located and a connection hub between Marrakesh, the people at High Atlas, and the ancient trade routes that used to cross the Sahara Desert.\\nIt’s an excellent base for those who want to explore the desert and the mountains, escaping for a while from the historical Moroccan big cities.\\nKasbah Ait Ben Haddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is nearby but the area is full of many other historical villages and palaces, more secluded and less touristic, and the lovely Fint Oasis.\\nOuarzazate is a great option for a Coliving Space in Morocco.\\nMust-visits in the city include the Kasbah Taourirt and the picturesque district of Tassoumaat. Movie fans can visit two film studios where movies like Lawrence of Arabia or The Gladiator were filmed, as well as some parts of Game of Thrones.\\nOuarzazate is a few hours away from Marrakesh by bus and there’s a small airport with daily connections to other cities in Morocco and some international routes, namely the ones operated by Ryanair from Madrid, Bordeaux, and Marseille.\\nDar Digital Nomad\\nThis is my space. I opened this house in April 2019.\\nDar Digital Nomad in Ouarzazate\\nDar Digital Nomad is a new coliving space. It’s located in a central but quiet area of Ouarzazate, within walking distance from the city’s main points of interest.\\nThe space was completely renovated and refurbished for coliving. The chosen décor combines the Morocco traditional style with the contemporary touch that the digital nomad expects.\\nUnlike what happens in most areas, at Dar Digital Nomad the atmosphere is more private with only two shared bedrooms with room for two people each. Each room has spacious bunk beds, one for female residents and one for male residents.\\nDar Digital Nomad is a great option for Coliving and Coworking space in Agadir.\\nThe apartment is equipped with a modern kitchen, a common area with a TV, and a work area with four big desks and four office chairs. Internet access is via optical fiber with 100mbps download and 10mbps upload.\\nPrices\\nAs for rates? Well, the minimum stay is for two weeks and costs 200 Euros. One-month stay can cost 340 Euros, and if you want to stay for longer, there are always ongoing special promotions. This price includes room, office and all house expenses such as electricity, water, gas and Internet.\\nDar Digital Nomad\\nColiving Spaces in Taghazout\\nCoworking and Coliving Spaces in Taghazout\\nTaghazout is a quiet fishing village with about 5,000 people, mostly Berbers, 20km north of Agadir.\\nIt’s famous for its beaches and popular among surfers, which makes it the perfect location for the digital nomads who practice this water sport.\\nThere is nothing better than getting work done in a couple of hours, riding the waves, and spending the rest of the day chatting with other members of the community.\\nTo break the daily routine of Taghazout, you can travel to Paradise Valley, a secluded area with great natural swimming pools.\\nSunDesk\\n© Sundesk\\n© Sundesk\\nSunDesk is more than a coworking space. It’s a living community of mostly young professionals who spend some time there while on the road, sometimes for a few weeks and sometimes for a few months.\\nSundesk is a great option for Coliving and Coworking space in Agadir.\\nYou don’t have to live there to access the services available to coworkers, but it’s not common to go to Taghazout just to use the coworking spaces at SunDesk.\\nThere are indoor and outdoor spaces and a dedicated room for teleconferences with enough privacy for meetings or remote interviews.\\nEach resident is entitled to a personal workspace with a desk, a lamp, an ergonomic chair, and a small storage unit. There’s a social corner where people can have complimentary tea, coffee, and even fruit.\\nFees vary according to time of year, length of stay, and room type (shared or private).\\nPrices\\nFor example, in the shoulder season, April and May, you’ll pay 600 Euros a month for a private room or 455 Euros for a bed in a two-person room. If you want to stay for less than a month, the daily rate is 25 Euros for the private room and 17.50 Euros for a bed in the twin room. Each apartment has one kitchen and two bedrooms.\\nThose rates include a hearty breakfast, daily housekeeping, a locker for valuable items, access to a fully equipped kitchen and a washing machine. In addition to this, of course, residents have permanent access to the coworking space.\\nSunDesk\\nColiving Spaces in Marrakesh\\nCoworking and Coliving Spaces in Marrakesh\\nAs one of the most popular cities in Morocco, Marrakesh needs no introduction. One of the highlights is the grand square Jemaa el-Fna, where the excitement never ends and peaks at the end of the day. It’s a place where travelers can appreciate different activities, including dance performances, boxing matches, storytelling, henna tattoos, and much more. The historical heritage is also vast and includes the Bahia Palace or El Badi Palace, extraordinary museums, and several outdoor spaces like the Majorelle Garden, once a private access garden and now owned by Yves St Laurent.\\nEven the medina, although not as impressive as the one in Fez, is still full of charming hidden corners and bustling commerce. However, keep in mind that the coliving space is at the Ourika Valley and you’ll probably be interested in exploring that region too, including experiencing the Agafay Desert 40 km from Marrakesh.\\nThe Outmakers\\n© The outmakers\\n© The outmakers\\nThe Outmakers is a coliving space with hubs in the French Alpes, Corsica, and Morocco. Here they’re established at Ourika Valley in the outskirts of Marrakesh.\\nJust 15 minutes from Morocco, this is a great option for those who need to focus on work, with a peaceful location and excellent views to the Atlas Mountains. There you’ll have all the commodities required for your daily routine, with a bar, a restaurant, a barbecue area, and a nice and spacious swimming pool.\\nThe Outmakers is a great option for Coliving and Coworking space in Marrakesh.\\nAccommodation style is mainly glamping – luxury tents with exquisite décor and comfort – but they also have more conventional double rooms available.\\nDuring working hours, residents can choose one of the several areas, from the pool area to the garden, including some indoor spaces.\\nSo that you have an idea of the size of the coliving space, there are two rooms, four large tents, and four small tents.\\nPrices\\nRates for a tent with a double bed is between 990 and 1290 Euros, depending on the size of the tent. If you choose to rent by the week, the daily rate is higher, between 350 and 490 Euros a week, which is the minimum duration of stay required.\\nA shared room for two people costs 450 Euros per person per month or 140 Euros per week per person for shorter stays. The rates include breakfast, private bathroom, daily housekeeping, and access to a kitchen.\\nThe Outmakers also has a 10 Euro transfer service to and from the airport. It’s a private vehicle that you can hire to go to Marrakesh too for the same price. The car has room for up to six passengers, so the fare can be split between the residents who hire the service.\\nThe Outmakers\\nCocoWork Marrakesh\\nThe Spot is the coworking space in Marrakesh that’s part of the CocoWork network. It’s located in the Gueliz district, near the train station and not too far from the medina, which you can reach on foot or, if the weather doesn’t permit, on a taxi or a bus that reaches the center of the old city in just a few minutes.\\nIt’s a joyful space, decorated with bright colors, with wooden tables and desks, with space for 70 people and four private offices and a meeting room.\\nPrices\\nAs for the rates, access is 140 Euros per month, 40 Euros per week, or 7 Euros per day. The space is available 24 hours a day.\\nCocoWork Marrakesh\\nIf you need to change locations for a couple of days, there’s another coworking space in the area called Fraktal Coworking.\\nColiving Spaces in Rabat\\nCoworking and Coliving Spaces in Rabat\\nRabat is one of the so-called imperial cities of Morocco and it’s currently the capital city of the country.\\nIn a way, it’s overlooked by international travelers who tend to be more interested in Marrakesh or even Fez.\\nRabat it’s really a city with lots of points of interest, combining the always fascinating heritage of the medina with top-notch modernity that’s unusual in the Moroccan nouvelle cités.\\nNot only can the city keep travelers busy and entertained for a long time, but it’s also well connected to the world and the rest of the country, and it’s the perfect base for those who want to work in Morocco for a while.\\nThe main attractions in Rabat are Chellah, a fortress lost in the middle of the old city, the King Hassan Tower and the Tomb of Mohammad V, the Oudaias Kasbah, which is the city’s historic center, the Andalusian Gardens and the Royal Palace.\\nFurthermore, Rabat has a beach and there are many more beaches around, so it’s the ideal set for digital nomads to have a good time.\\n7AY\\n© 7AY\\n© 7AY\\n7AY is split into two parts, physically separated and located in different parts of the Moroccan capital. The coliving area is in the center of Rabat, in partnership with a local riad.\\nThe coworking space is a bit further, in a part of the city near the Industrial Neighborhood. You can travel between both areas by taxi, which takes about 15 minutes and costs 2.50 Euros.\\nThe coworking space is housed in an old warehouse and has a total area of 780 square meters. The décor and layout of the area are contemporary, somewhat minimalist, with light colors where white prevails.\\n7AY is a great option for Coworking space in Rabat.\\nThere is room for 75 people in the spacious common area of the coworking (most desks are designed to accommodate four people), but it also includes private offices, meeting rooms, a multipurpose space, areas to relax and socialize, a well-equipped kitchen, two courtyards, and some surprises like a 100 square meter Berber tent, a rooftop garden, and a panoramic deck with a view to the Boureggreg Valley.\\nAs expected, here you’ll have all the needed equipment to work as a digital nomad: printers and scanners, photocopiers, and fast internet, officially 100 Mbps, that you can connect via cable.\\nIn addition to all that, there are locker rooms with showers, a cafeteria serving the drinks you’d expect to find at these spaces, and it’s fully climatized with heaters for the colder winters and air conditioning for the hot summer days.\\n7AY has a strong connection to the Moroccan artistic community and frequently hosts events related to art, from exhibitions and conferences to workshops.\\n7HAY\\nColiving Space in Fez\\nCoworking and Coliving Space in Fez\\nFez is one of the imperial cities of Morocco and its medina is the largest urban area in the world without car traffic.\\nIt’s a whole world to discover, with ancient corners, charming cafes, museums, fairytale palaces, and the legendary area where they dye leather in colorful tubs that are wonderful to photograph.\\nIt’s quite accessible too. It’s well connected to Morocco railway, and you can easily travel to other places in the country. The local airport also has excellent connections to Europe, usually at affordable prices, namely with Spain and France.  \\nCocoWork Fez\\nIn Fez, the coworking space associated with CocoWork is called Bridges to the Future. It seems to cater mostly to the local community because of some details like the pictures used on their website and the fact that the site is only available in French.\\nBut apparently, it’s the only option available in one most consider the most exciting city in Morocco.\\nCocoWork is a great option for Coworking space in Fez.\\nCocoWork Fez\\nColiving Spaces in Casablanca\\nCoworking and Coliving Spaces in Casablanca\\nThe largest city in Morocco is part of a lot of people’s imagination, especially the older generation because of the legendary movie with the same name, one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. However, the real Casablanca has little to do with that romantic atmosphere, and it grew to become a modern city.\\nCasablanca’s historic center is small but very charming. Nearby you can visit the Grand Mosque Hassan II, the largest in Africa and the fifth largest in the world. There are small squares around where the locals hang out, surrounded by small local restaurants, perfect places to people watch and seize the day.\\nBecause of its size, Casablanca is one of the most accessible locations in the country. It’s easy to reach the airport by train, from the station in the city center. And from the terminals of Mohammed V International, you can travel to anywhere in the world, including Lisbon, with direct flights operated by TAP and Royal Air Maroc.\\nCocoWork Casablanca\\nCommon is the main coworking space connected with CocoWork in Casablanca. It’s located between La Gironde and Habbous, in an area that has good technical conditions to work but that’s a bit far (about 4km) from the most iconic places in the city.\\nThe space is housed in a modern two-floor building, with floor-to-ceiling huge windows that bring in a lot of light and positive energy. Despite the contemporary look, the coworking space managers gave it a traditional touch using mosaics on the walls and adding other décor details that connect the Moroccan culture with the technological changes from the West.\\nCocoWork is a great option for Coworking space in Casablanca.\\nCommon has a total of 60 work stations, including 30 private offices and four meeting rooms, supported by a suitable computer network, good internet, printers, photocopiers, scanners, and projectors. You can access the space 24 hours a day, and for animal lovers, there is good news too because you can bring your dog or cat to work.\\nThere’s a pleasant area outdoors, great to be inspired in the days when the weather is nice, a kitchen, lockers, and the usual complimentary drinks (tea and coffee).\\nAs a bonus, they organize events and workshops dedicated to the topic and the lifestyle of being a digital nomad.\\nPrices\\nAccess to Common costs about 150 Euros a month or, for shorter stays, about 12 Euros a day.\\nCocoWork Casablanca\\nAlthough Common is the main CocoWork coworking space in Casablanca, there are other similar spaces in the same area. Netscape is not too far away, on the same avenue. And then, not too far either, you have Capital Desk, Dasthetica, Interface Office Space, New York Lab, Biz Jahiz and Kowork Al Massira. Smart Center is the furthest, in the suburbs north of the city.\\nCoworking Spaces CocoWork\\n(in Casablanca, Marrakesh, Fez)\\nCocoWork’s concept is a bit different because they don’t offer accommodation. The community gathers at the coworking space but lives temporarily in Airbnb listings selected and suggested by CocoWork.\\nThe options are chosen based on location and the facilities a digital nomad expects to find in a temporary home. Therefore, residents can expect a short commute from their accommodation and the coworking space, as well as an excellent WiFi connection.\\nIn addition to this, they work hard in gathering all information: cafes where you can work for a while, restaurants, cool hangouts, and all the exciting places for a digital nomad. This information is sourced and laid in a digital map and available on the mobile app that members of the CocoWork community have access to.\\nIn some cases, the spaces are independent and have a coliving area that partners with the CocoWork network for convenience, like Sundesk in Taghazout and 7AY in Rabat.\\nCocoWork Morocco\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nDifferent world map projections\\nUsually, every traveler has a love for world projections. I mean, put a world map in front of me, and I can look at it for hours. Come with me and let’s compare the different variants of planispheres and the different projections of a map of the world.\\nDifferent world map projections:\\nThe Mercator projection\\nThe Mollweide projection\\nThe Peters projection\\nThe Winkel projection\\nThe Robinson projection\\nQuick Interesting facts:\\nThere are more than two hundred different map projections.\\nEach projection distorts maps in different ways.\\nThe projection we are used is commonly known as the Mercator projection.\\nWhat we see in a world map projection is not an accurate representation of the planet.\\nAbout world maps in general\\nThe most common world maps are the ones called political maps that show the main cities of each country, usually the capitals, and the borders between each nation.\\nBut sometimes there are different maps combined into one. The physical maps show the planet’s morphology in three dimensions, with information about the relief, above and under the sea, and the soils and vegetation.\\nSeveral projections of a world map\\nSome Planispheres follow a theme, usually connected to a human or natural event, such as the number of people living in an area or levels of pollution, while others represent historical events such as invasions, migrations, or how borders evolved over time.\\nThe Mercator projection was used until today although it dates from the 16th century, and it’s a milestone in the History of cartography. But world maps already existed long before Gerardus Mercator came up with his system.\\nBefore Mercator: Learn more\\nWorld Map\\nWorld maps already existed before Gerardus Mercator created his system.\\nThose were based on the system created by Greek scholar Ptolemy and designed on a grid with latitudes and longitudes. But they focused more on descriptions than accuracy, so it’s dubious that they represented the world as it was then.\\nDon’t forget that in the Middle Ages many people believed the Earth was flat and that the end of the world was literally on the edges. It didn’t matter if centuries before Ancient Greek scientists had determined the real shape of the planet.\\nAlthough Ptolemy’s principles were followed academically, less educated people believed, in fact, the Earth was flat. Can you imagine how terrified the sailors were during the Age of Discoveries? Sailing away in uncharted seas, imagining they would reach the end of the world soon and fall over into oblivion.\\nSome maps became a classic and part of History, like the fantastic Tabula Rogeriana created by Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi in 1154 that shows the north in the bottom.\\nEbstorf Map, created in the first quarter of the 13th century, was found in a convent in 1843. It’s very similar to another medieval map, the Hereford Mappa Mundi in England. In both maps, Jerusalem is the center of the world and the east is on top. There are notations in the margins of the map with descriptions of the world as they knew it then, including notes about the fauna.\\nThese are just some examples. There are dozens of medieval Mappa Mundi, created before the Mercator Projection. Those include the maps of Psalter (13th century), Theodulf of Orléans (11th century), Isidore of Seville (8th century), and Pietro Vesconte (14th century).\\nAll Map Projections Compared And Visualized by Geoawesomeness\\nAsia also created some maps of the world as it was known then. The Da Ming Hun Yi Tu was created between the 14th and 15th centuries in China, and its name can be translated into something like “the amalgamated map of the Great Ming Empire.”\\nChina is, of course, in the center and Europe is represented as very tiny and compressed near the border of the planisphere. Africa is represented with the focus on the east coast as seen from India.\\nThe Kangnido map was created in Korea at the beginning of the 15th century, inspired by the cartography techniques of China and sponsored by the Joseon Dynasty. The main focal point of the map is, of course, Korea.\\nTop 5 different world map projections\\nLet’s start with our comparison between the maps.\\n1. The Mercator Projection\\nThe Mercator world map projection\\nFrom all the world map projections, this is the one most of us are used to see. It was created by Gerardus Mercator, a cartographer and maker of globes from Flanders who lived in the 16th century. And let’s take advantage of the fact that it’s familiar to us as a tool to showcase how the need to show the Earth on a flat surface can misrepresent it.\\nIn the Mercator Projection, Greenland is as big as Africa, and Alaska looks bigger than Brazil. But what if I told you that Mexico is more or less the size of Greenland and Alaska is about one fifth the size of Brazil?\\nYes, the famous world map we used to study from is flawed.\\nThe classic planisphere based on the Mercator Projection places Europe in the center. In cartography, that’s called Eurocentrism, a trend that remained almost intact until the present time. But it’s understandable. After all, Europe was the home of Gerardus Mercator and most of his clients were European.\\nAlthough it became natural for us to use this map in our daily lives, initially those maps based on the Mercator Projection were meant to be used at sea.\\nMercator is used for navigation or maps of equatorial regions. Any straight line between two points is a true line of constant direction, but not usually the shortest distance between the two points. Distances are true only along the equator but are reasonably correct within 15° either side. Areas and shapes of large areas are distorted. Distortion increases away from the equator and is extreme in polar regions (Greenland appears larger than Africa but is actually 14 times smaller). Parallels and meridians are straight lines which meet at right angles. Meridians are equally spaced but parallels are stretched towards the poles. Poles are not shown.\\nWorld maps by The Guardian\\n2. The Mollweide Projection\\nThe Mollweide world map projection\\nThis projection was created by German mathematician and astronomer Karl Brandan Mollweide and published for the first time in 1805. It became popular again in 1850 thanks to the work of Jacques Babinet who called it Homolographic Projection.\\nIt’s a pseudo-cylindric projection with an equator line and a perpendicular meridian half its size. Parallels are straight lines that compress as they get closer to the poles, while meridians are shown as curved lines.\\nAlthough it’s represented in a planisphere as an ellipse, the central areas are precise, but the side areas are distorted.\\nThis projection sacrifices the precision of some of the angles and shapes, in exchange for a better representation of the planet’s proportions when that is an important consideration.\\nOther lesser-known models were created based on the Mollweide Projection, such as the Van der Grinten Projection or the Boggs Euromorphic Projection.\\n3. The Peters Projection\\nThe Peters world map projection\\nThe Arno Peters Projection is recent, from 1973, but inspired by the Gall Projection from the 19th century.\\nSome say that because Arno Peters worked at a time when worldwide decolonization was coming to an end, he tried to reset the cartographic representation of the world by taking away the importance of the western world in the maps designed so far according to Mercator Projection. The result was extreme and overcompensated the significance of the southern hemisphere.\\nMaps based on the Peters Projection are widely used in English-speaking schools and by UNESCO.\\n4. The Winkel Tripel Projection\\nThe Winkel Tripel world map projection\\nCreated in 1921 by German cartographer Oswald Winkle it’s called “tripel” (the German word for triple) because Winkel tried to minimize the distortions threefold, in area, distance, and direction.\\nThis method was used by the National Geographic Society in the US in 1998, replacing the previous maps based on the Robinson Projection. Since then, many schools and textbooks have adopted the Winkel Tripel Projection.\\n4. The Robinson Projection\\nThe Robinson world map projection\\nIn 1963, the American geographer Arthur G. Robinson introduced an alternative projection system that, unlike what was normal until then, wasn’t based on the transposition of points by mathematical equations but by a system of tables.\\nAlthough his model represented the continents more accurately than the Mercator Projection, the poles are highly distorted.\\nFor ten years, from 1988 to 1998, the National Geographic Society in the US used this projection. Before that, they had used the Van der Grintem Projection and, after that, the Winkel Tripel Projection.\\nOther Projections\\nI mentioned the main projections used since the Middle Ages to represent the Earth on maps, but many more projections were created throughout the years, although none of them as popular or as widely used as the ones I listed above.\\nThe search for the perfect map has kept cartographers and mathematicians all over the world busy, which resulted in many more projections. Those include the Cassini Projection (1745), the Gauss-Kruger Projection (1822), the Miller Projection (1942), the Behrman Projection (1910), the Hobo-Dyer Projection (2002), and the Collignon Projection (1865).\\nThose are just some of the dozens of projections out there so you can grasp the diversity of creations in this field. Some are older concepts perfected, while others are built upon older versions of themselves, such as Eckert II, IV and VI.\\nThe Different Centers of the Planispheres\\nLet’s not talk about different map projections for a moment and focus on how the representation of Earth on a planisphere can change based on what is chosen as the center.\\nFor example, when we think of a world map, we visualize a representation based on the Mercator Projection with Europe in the center. It’s only natural because Mercator defined how maps were made for over 500 years and he was European. His perspective was the only one for many years.\\nHowever, you can change the center of a planisphere and that’s been used as a weapon by nationalist movements or to sustain some scientific theories, especially in the field of geopolitics.\\nMap with all continents » different projections of world maps\\nMap with all the seven continents: Africa, Asia, Pacific, North America, South America, Oceania and Antarctica\\nMercator’s Eurocentrism can easily be replaced and, for example, maps in the USA show a different planet Earth where Europe fades to the side, about where we’d picture India in a planisphere. In Japan, planispheres place the land of the rising sun top and center.\\nThese are refreshing variations that show us different graphic perspectives of our planet that we aren’t used to and helps us see details we had never noticed before.\\nFor example, the closeness between Russia and the USA, only 80 km from each other, separated by the Bearing Strait that separates Alaska from the Russian area of Chukotka.\\nOr the flight routes that seem absurd to those who are used to Mercator’s Eurocentrism but that makes perfect sense for those who see the planet as a globe.\\nPlanisphere Variants\\nThe most common world maps are the ones called political maps that show the main cities of each country, usually the capitals, and the borders between each nation. But sometimes there are different maps combined into one.\\nThe physical maps show the planet’s morphology in three dimensions, with information about the relief, above and under the sea, and the soils and vegetation.\\nSome Planispheres follow a theme, usually connected to a human or natural event, such as the number of people living in an area or levels of pollution while others represent historical events such as invasions, migrations, or how borders evolved.\\nElements of a Planisphere\\nA good planisphere has a series of elements to describe its characteristics. Some are optional, but others are essential and almost mandatory.\\nAll planispheres must have a scale, but distortion will make this element less precise. Although in a planisphere direction is obvious, we all know which side is north, this element is also mandatory. The legend has essential information that explains the colors and symbols used on the map.\\nMost maps have a title, the projection method and, especially in older planispheres, the name of the cartographer who designed it and the date.\\nWhat about the Internet?\\nThe cartographic tool most used online, and even offline for some time now, is Google Maps. Despite all its tools and possibilities, Google Maps uses an adapted Mercator Projection, and so does Bing Maps, Yahoo Maps, OpenStreetMap, and MapQuest.\\nBut the Internet brought us something else, a great tool that allows us to see the planet in two dimensions without distortion: Google Earth. With this system, the user can spin the globe, zoom in to the points they want to see closer, and although it’s not technically a map because it’s a series of grouped satellite photos, it provides a correct visual perception of the world where scales, angles, and shapes are preserved.\\nCheck out this interesting website to compare map projections.\\nWorld map projections\\nWrapping Up\\nWhat have we learned from all these different world map projections?\\nThat what we see in a world map projection is not an accurate representation of the planet, and it couldn’t be because it’s impossible to represent a globe in two dimensions.\\nThe Earth is not flat, as some of the scholars of Ancient Greece had mentioned before. And because it’s not flat, any attempt to represent it on a map will somewhat fail.\\nOver the centuries, mathematicians and cartographers tried to define the best method to minimize distortion that comes from creating a planisphere, but the best solution is still not consensual.\\nIf you want to have a real perception of what our planet is like without distortions and with the correct proportions, it’s better to use a globe. That is an accurate model of Earth.\\nIt’s true that even those follow a specific pattern, with the North Pole at the top and the South Pole at the bottom, but it’s still a more accurate tool than a planisphere.\\nAlso read my page:\\nVisited countries map maker – Create your travel map\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nDriving in Oman\\nDriving in Oman\\nOman is a fascinating country that has just been discovered by mainstream tourism in recent years. More than a decade ago, I had the chance of driving in Oman and visit some of the country’s best attractions and points of interest.\\nAs most of you know, I love to travel and drive, so I didn’t waste time in getting myself a rental car in Muscat and drive around the country without any previously made itinerary or planning.\\nI entered Oman hitchhiking on a truck, coming from the United Arab Emirates all the way to Khasab, in the Ras Musandam Peninsula. After, I got a ferry-boat to Muscat from where I started my road trip in Oman.\\nDuring my two weeks Oman road trip I visited many castles, sand dunes, archaeological sites, markets, mountains and even a prophet’s tomb.\\nRead my article on the Oman Ministry of Tourism official website:\\nOman’s best off-the-beaten-track adventures\\nWhy to visit Oman?\\nWhy to visit Oman\\nThe history of Oman began in antiquity, when this region was already considered an indispensable place in commercial trade.\\nThere are a few interesting historical facts about Oman, such as that in Sumerian language, the region was called “Magan.” Also curious to point is that the country was once ruled by the Achaemenid Empire, also called the First Persian Empire, founded 2500 years ago by Cyrus the Great.\\nThe Arabic tribes reached the region during the 1st century, overpowering the Persians who lost all their influence in the area. The Ibadi Muslims managed to establish in Oman, creating an imamate that lasted until the 20th century.\\nThe Portuguese visited and conquered Muscat in the 16th century, where they stayed until the successful military attack by the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century.\\nLed by Ahmed Ibn Said, a group of organized Sultans fought out the Ottomans in the next century. In the 19th century, Oman became a world power, protected by Great Britain. By indications of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, Oman and Muscat would become only known as Oman.\\nTraditionally, men wear the dishdashi, an ankle-length collarless robe, with long sleeves, usually white. The muzzar turban is also a necessary accessory. Women wear sirwal (pants) and a lihaf (head scarf). The most important event is, of course, Ramadan, the month dedicated to fasting.\\nIt’s always kind of hard how to explain when you like a certain destination and why one should visit.\\nOman is not one of those countries because the reasons why to visit are too obvious:\\nWelcoming people,\\nSafe environment for travelers,\\nAmazing landscapes,\\nGreat beaches,\\nBreathtaking mountains,\\nLively markets,\\nMore than 500 of historical castles and forts,\\nInteresting archaeological sites.\\nThe climate of Oman is scorching and also quite humid in the summer months. The best time to visit Oman is during the winter months (between November and March), as temperatures are much more pleasant. Temperatures are contrasting between day and night, as during the day they reach 50º C. The rainy region is in the south of the Dhofar, although along the coast the climate is milder.\\nMy itinerary in Oman\\nOman Road Trip\\nOman road trip, map Muscat to Salalah\\nOman road trip, map Salalah to Muscat\\nStart: Muscat\\nSamail Fort\\nMasirah Island\\nRas Madrakah\\nRima Petrostation\\nSalalah\\nSadah Coast\\nMirbat\\nTaqah\\nSumhuram ruins\\nAl-Baleed ruins\\nSalalah\\nTomb of Prophet Job (Ayub)\\nUbar\\nRamlat as Sahmah (dunes)\\nFahud\\nNizwa\\nJabreen Castle\\nBahla Fort\\nJebel Akhdar\\nHaat village\\nRustaq\\nAl Hazm\\nEnd: Muscat\\nMap of rental car trip in Oman\\nRent a car in Muscat\\nTotal KM: 3071 km (1908 mi)\\nOman Geography\\nCrossing the Jbel Akhdar with rental car\\nOman has a land area of 212,460 km2, and is located in Southwest Asia, more precisely in the Southeast of the Arabian Peninsula. Oman territory also includes the small enclave of the Musandam Peninsula in the Strait of Hormuz, and the Masirah and al-Hallaniyah islands.\\nDriving in Oman is an incredible experience because we can cross rocky mountains, sand deserts and coastal regions in just one single trip.\\nOman borders Yemen to the Southwest, Saudi Arabia to the West and the United Arab Emirates to the Northwest. The landscapes in the north are mainly composed by desert and sand, better known as Batinah, while in the south the Hagar Mountains are the most prominent natural feature of the region. The highest point of the Hajar Mountain Range, which runs parallel to the Gulf of Oman, is Mount Djebel Al-Akhdar, with 3107 meters.\\nMy Top 9 Favorite places in Oman\\n1. Samail Fort\\nVisit Samail Fort in Oman\\nSamail Castle was undoubtedly the most beautiful castle I visited in Oman. The Samail Hosn, or Samail Castle, is surrounded by mountains and huge palm trees. A real oasis in the desert mountains. A few kilometers before Samail there is another small fort. This is known for its watchtowers which overlook the entire valley.\\n2. Jebel Akhdar\\nVisit Jebel Akhdar in Oman\\nCrossing the Jebel Akhdar was one of the best moments of my Oman trip. I drove up departing from Al Hamra until Ar Rustaq, on the other side of the mountain. These tracks are to be made with a 4wd, but I drove a regular city car. If by chance you also do it (I mean, without a 4WD), I advise you to drive very carefully. Landscapes are amazing. Everything is breathtaking.\\n3. The Jabreen Fort\\nVisit Jabreen Fort in Oman\\nThe Jabreen Fort, built in the 17th century in Bahla, Al Dakhiliyah region, is known as the most charming fortress in Oman. After his father cleared the Portuguese out of this territory, Imam Bel Arab bin Sultan Al Yarubi built this fortress. At the time, they were living in an unprecedented age of peace and prosperity. The fort was meant to showcase the wealth of those times without wars.\\n4. Nizwa\\nVisit Nizwa in Oman\\nNizwa is the most important city in the mountainous region in the center of Oman, an excellent base for the traveler who wants to explore some of the best attractions of that area: oasis, magnificent mountains, watering and water collection systems, abandoned villages, medieval forts, quaint markets.\\n5. The Tomb of Job\\nVisit the Tomb of Job in Oman\\nThe Tomb of Job is located in the mountains, near Salalah, in southern Oman. Job (or Ayoub, in Arabic) is the main character of the Bible’s Old Testament book of Job. After struggling all his life and trying to understand the reasons for that struggle, Job’s devotion was rewarded by God. You’ll see Job’s footprint near the prophet’s tomb, one of the reasons why so many religious pilgrims visit this site.\\n6. Muscat\\nVisit Muscat in Oman\\nMuscat is the capital city of Oman and, to many visitors, the gateway into the country, the first pit stop before venturing out to discover the sultanate’s wonders. Thanks to its long History, Muscat has many points of interest that will keep you entertained, including the stately Sultan Qaboos Mosque and the Portuguese forts.\\n7. Masirah Island\\nVisit Masirah Island in Oman\\nMasirah Island, one of the 11 provinces of Oman, is about 95 Km long and 14 Km wide. Fishing and the textile industry replaced shipbuilding, one of the former significant sources of revenue. The rugged terrain (the bottom of the sea is all hard rock) and the unstable currents make it impossible for boats to sail regularly, so one of the most exciting scenes you’ll see on this island is the number of shipwrecks. The strong winds make it an excellent place to Windsurf or Kitesurf, and the ocean’s perfect conditions also attract many surfers.\\n8. Taqah and Sumhuram Archaeological Park\\nVisit Sumhuram Archaeological Park in Oman\\nTaqah is a city on the coast, in Dhofar, Oman. It’s about 40 km from Salalah. The population’s primary sources of income are fishing and agriculture, which means you’ll eat well here. Here you’ll see the most famous castle south of Oman, the Taqah Castle. This beautiful building was built in the 19th century, quite recent when compared to the other castles in the North of Oman. It was the official residence of Sheik Ali bin Al Taman Ma’shani, Sultan Qaboos’ great-grandfather. Four towers were added to the original building in the 1960s, and it’s now a museum worth visiting for its grandeur. Next to the Taqah Castle is the cemetery where Sultan Qaboos’ mother was laid to rest. Don’t miss out on visiting the Sumhuram Archaeological Park (the oldest pre-Islamic settlement) with a view to the Khor Rori Natural reserve, a sanctuary for many birds including flamingos.\\n9. Al Hazm\\nVisit Al Hazm Castle in Oman\\nAl Hazm Castle is also an incredible sight. The green of the palm trees mixed with the desert landscape is as beautiful as it is hard to describe. Al Hazm Castle adds contrast to the view, against the backdrop of mountains when we see it from afar. It’s a two-floor building with an interior courtyard and two round towers on the South and the East ends. It houses some government offices, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of National Heritage specifically, but visits are allowed inside. A true symbol of local architecture, this massive monument was restored in 1996. You can feel the History of the place, intensely.\\n10. Bahla Fort\\nVisit Bahla Fort in Oman\\nThe Bahla Fort in Oman was built in the 13th and 14th centuries by orders of Banu Nebhan. Together with the Forts of Izki, Nizwa, and Rustaq, it served as a full-fledged defense mechanism from the constant attacks suffered here. It’s an impressive construction atop many plains, with 132 watching towers and 15 gates. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it’s been frequently restored over time. The fort is worth the trip and if you’re unfortunate to find it closed, the outside alone is impressive enough. You’ll still have a monument full of History and charisma before you.\\n11. Salalah\\nVisit Salalah in Oman\\nSalalah is the biggest city and the capital of the Dhofar province. It’s the birthplace of Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Commercially speaking, it was a highly successful city in the 13th century thanks to the incense trade and the fruit trade (mostly coconut). However, prosperity didn’t last forever, and the Muscat sultanate took its place in the 19th century becoming the capital city. Khareef attracts many tourists, between June and September. It’s a great way to freshen up from the intense desert heat, and it’s also how cities such as Salalah get their water supply. If you have the chance, travel during the Khareef season to visit the Al Marnif Cave and Mughsail beach in Shatti Al Mughsail (40 km from Salalah). It’s a genuinely magical scenery in the fog and drizzle: the beach, thick sand, and the rough seas, absolutely gorgeous.\\n12. The Lost City of Ubar\\nVisit the Lost City of Ubar in Oman\\nFrequently known as the Lost City of Ubar or Atlantis of the Sands. Destroyed by a natural catastrophe, the city has been the setting for many stories in literature (“Atlantis of the Sands,” by Ranulph Fiennes) and in movies (“Lawrence of Arabia,” by David Lean).\\nAbout 5,000 BC years ago, this legendary city was incredibly wealthy thanks to the commercial trade of incense from the Qara Mountains. Incense was as valuable as gold; both used as medicine and in religious ceremonies. With the help of satellite images, a group of archaeologists found Ubar, the fortress city buried in quicksand.\\nThey discovered a limestone bunker built by King Shaddad ibn to use in case of a catastrophe, but they didn’t find any human remains inside. However, before this happened, Ubar was like a representation of paradise. People lived in tents, so there aren’t many traces of a settlement. There is, however, a vast fortress with several towers, which is why Ubar is mentioned in the Koran as the city of many towers.\\nAlthough Ubar sounds very exciting, don’t expect much from the site itself. If you’re a history freak like I am, you will find it interesting to visit.\\nRead my other pages about Oman:\\n25 Amazing places to visit in Oman\\nVisit Ras Musandam – The forgotten peninsula of Oman\\nMasirah – a desolated island on the coast of Oman\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

At least tourism as we understand it, because the pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina bring to the country millions of people a year, but they are religious tourists.\\nDriving in Saudi Arabia came up as the perfect idea in order to explore this Arab kingdom independently. During two weeks, I drove my rental car 3000 km (1864 mi) along some of the most beautiful sites of the northern region of Saudi Arabia. Hopefully, I will visit Saudi Arabia once again, and explore the southern regions.\\nSaudi Arabia conservative nature leads it to reduce contact with the outside to the bare minimum, especially as far as the Western world is concerned. It is one of the countries in the world for which it is almost impossible to obtain a tourist visa, especially for an independent trip, but now there is news of a controlled opening.\\nThe heir to the throne aims to boost tourism in Saudi Arabia, and talks about the opening of new resorts, to rival the neighboring United Arab Emirates on this front.\\nMohammed Bin Salman wants 30 million tourists to visit his country by 2030.

It is best to carefully study what you can and can not do during your visit to stay safe from incidents with the authorities.\\nRead my page:\\nIs Saudi Arabia a dangerous country to travel?\\nEthnically, the 90% overwhelming majority of citizens are Arabs.

But the truth is that the most enduring capital of the Arab Empire was Baghdad in Iraq.\\nRead my page:\\nVisit Baghdad – City Adventure Guide to the capital of Iraq\\nTwo weeks in Saudi Arabia\\nSmall video of my two-week trip to Saudi Arabia.\\nObserving the map of the region helps to understand the situation: Saudi Arabia occupies 80% of the Arabian peninsula, and its size is far superior to any of the other Arab countries in the Gulf.\\nIt has a considerable area, covering an extension equivalent to half of the European Union, but has only 27 million inhabitants. That is, it is sparsely populated.\\nRiyadh, the capital of the country, is at the center of the map. Medina, Mecca, and now Jeddah, are located in a relatively small area, on a strip near the west coast, bathed by the Red Sea.\\nBasically Saudi Arabia borders the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to the west and east, with Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates as its neighbors to the south. To the north, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait. Little Qatar and tiny Bahrain are like enclaves on the eastern shore of Saudi Arabia.\\nRoad in Saudi Arabia\\nThis position gives Saudi Arabia tremendous strategic importance. Its coasts control two main sea routes: the Persian Gulf, through which a large part of the world’s oil trade passes, and the Red Sea, the port of entry and exit of ships passing through the Suez Canal transit between Europe and the coast eastern parts of Africa and much of Asia.\\nLet us now read the geographical aspects of the map of Saudi Arabia. To the south, running from east to west, one sees a huge desert, the largest contiguous sand area in the world, which they call Rub ‘al-Khali, with a length of 647,500 km2.\\nFrom here it rises to the north what can be considered an extension of this zone, but in fact practically the whole country is a set of deserts connected to each other that gives the global name of Desert of Arabia.\\nDriving in Saudi Arabia means that you will have to drive long distances which is easily achieved due to the excellent road network.\\nWorld Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\\nAD-DIRIYAH SAUDI ARABIA\\nDespite the difficulties in getting a tourist visa, and the country’s resistance to Western visitors, it can not be said that Saudi Arabia has little to offer. Its beaches, especially on the Red Sea coast, are fabulous, but we can take a look at the list of World Heritage Sites maintained by UNESCO, which is always a great way to embrace at a glance the best that a country has to present to its visitors. I had the chance of visiting three of these UNESCO places in Saudi Arabia. I also arrived at Mada’in Saleh (also called Al-Ḥijr), but it was temporarily closed due to rebuilding.\\n1.

Today, one can observe some of these testimonies, like the tower houses, being the most remarkable example of this line of construction the one of Roshan, erected in the 19th-century.\\nThe historic center of Jeddah is made up of several elements that contributed to the inclusion in the list of UNESCO, which happened in 2014: the old city walls, mosques, markets and palaces.\\n  3. Rock Art in the Hail Region\\nJubbah\\nIn this region, located in the mountain range of Jabel Umm Sinman, there is a remarkable density of petroglyphs.

Yet it has been damaged by war for many decades. Traveling in Afghanistan by car is not a holiday option for most travelers, but those who actually visit it come back with great travel memoirs.\\nTaking your own car into Afghanistan is entirely possible and very doable. Writing a survival guide about driving Afghanistan may seem crazy, but there are a few travelers, adventurous enough to enter the country driving their own wheels, either by car or motorcycle.\\nRoad from the Tajik border to Kunduz\\nAfghanistan by Car\\nDriving Afghanistan\\nGet your Road Permit\\nRoad permit of vehicle entrance to Afghanistan\\nDriving in Afghanistan will require a document called road permit or permit of vehicle entrance to Afghanistan. This particular document can be issued by the consulate or embassy where you’re making your Afghan visa.\\nThe road permit to Afghanistan costs $100 US. Along with the money (that has to be paid at a local bank), you have to fill in a form and make a written declaration of what you will be doing in the country. I wrote that I was going to visit several cities for tourism purposes.\\nYour safety at risk\\nRoad to Kabul in Afghanistan\\nNot all cities, towns and villages are dangerous;\\nNot all cities, towns and villages are safe;\\nSome regions are entirely off-limits to westerns;\\nTry to get informed about the situation in the region you’re driving in Afghanistan by talking to the local population, border guards, Afghan army;\\nInform yourself about which villages on your itinerary are pro-Taliban. These should be avoided, and you shouldn’t stop there by all means. A guy from the bank gave me great tips about where not to stop along the road to Kabul;\\nProbably the best, most accurate and up-to-date information about safety in Afghanistan comes from Afghans living in neighboring countries such as Tajikistan or Uzbekistan. These people are often driving in Afghanistan once or twice a month. I had reliable information about road safety while talking to an Afghan air ticket seller living in Dushanbe – Tajikistan. I almost quit my overland trip and was trying to decide whether to fly or not, until he told me: “Why aren’t you going? My boss goes there every month by car. He just came back yesterday”;\\nRoad Conditions\\nDriving in Afghanistan near the city of Balkh\\nGet up-to-date information about road conditions and safety from the US and the Afghan army. While driving in Afghanistan, one must be alert at all times. At the Shir Khan Bandar Afghan border with Tajikistan, US officials advised me not to take a dirt/sand road heading West. Driving south to Kabul through Pol-e Khomri, on an asphalted road, would be a much wiser alternative;\\nGenerally speaking, roads in Afghanistan are in excellent conditions, and many have new asphalt;\\nWhile driving in Afghanistan, you have to be careful with side road mines. Don’t just park your car aside from the road to urinate. First of all, this is a great offense to local people – to urinate in public. Secondly, side road mines are lethal. Although there are frequent demining vehicles in action on the main roads in Afghanistan, road mines can be put just after the demining vehicles pass;\\nDemining vehicles on the road before Samangan – Aybak\\nWatch the video: Demining Afghanistan – A picture tale: Moving from Aid to Trade by international road transport from the International Road Transport Union (IRU).\\nLocal People\\nFriendly ice-cream seller on the streets of Balkh\\nAfghan troops on the road to Kunduz\\nGuys from a restaurante on the road to Mazar\\nGuys from the phone shop in Baghlan\\nRestaurant worker in the city of Mazar\\nVery friendly guy that works on a bank in Kunduz, he took me to exchange money in the black market\\nAfghan border official that took me shopping to get water\\nRespect local customs, values, and ideas. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has a very religious population. A stronger type of Islam is practiced in Afghanistan compared to other more permissive countries like Morocco or Turkey;\\nThere are restaurants aside all the roads connecting major cities in Afghanistan. A decent meal is very cheap;\\nMake friends along the way. Afghans are very curious and friendly people. Try to engage in being receptive and interact as much as possible.\\nExchanging money\\nKunduz City center – Driving in Afghanistan\\nMost banks don’t exchange Euros bank notes. You have to exchange them on the black market. Go with a local to help you out. Money markets in Afghanistan will definitely have many Taliban sympathies and probably some Taliban members. If you’re coming with a local that explains who you are, maybe you can get away with it easily and you might actually make new friends since Taliban are no more and no less than regular Afghans, they just share different religious/political ideas;\\nBig cities have many money exchange kiosks on the streets. Most young guys that sell SIM cards and phone payment top-ups usually also exchange money – Euros and US dollars;\\nWhere to get the Afghan visa\\nI got my Afghan visa within 1 hour in Khorugh, in the autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan – Tajikistan. To get a visa to Afghanistan on the same day you must be outside Khorugh consulate on Monday early in the morning when it opens. The Afghanistan visa costs (June 2012: Visas can be processed in 24 hours. Cost is $100 for EU citizens, $200 for US citizens. They must be paid at the Tojik Sodirot Bank and can be processed in 24 hours. Visas will not be issued on Israeli passports or on passports with Israeli border stamps on it.\\nI was told back in June 2012 by the consul in Khorugh that the road from Ishkashim to Faizabad was not passable due to Taliban activity, the only possible route was from Khorugh to Faizabad, but only for 4X4, not a 2WD like mine.\\nRead the page: Visa to Afghanistan – updated information.\\nAfghanistan Road Report\\nRoad from Tajikistan Border to Kunduz\\nRoad from Tajikistan Border to Kunduz- Driving in Afghanistan\\nThe road from the border of Tajikistan to Kunduz is almost entirely on the tarmac, except for a part that has a bridge that seems to have had a bomb explosion and it’s completely destroyed. This little part of the way has to be done off the road, inside the river.\\nCompared to the rest of the routes I did in Afghanistan, the landscapes throughout this area were green. Along the border with Tajikistan, everything was arid and sandy but quickly started to have vegetation all the way to Kunduz.\\nNOTE: This road is about 65km from the border to Kunduz, and on the halfway point it had at least two army checkpoints. The military stopped me, asked for my passport and made me some questions about my reason for being in Afghanistan and why I was traveling as a tourist. In the end, we took pictures together. The Afghan army is very friendly.\\nRoad from Kunduz to Pol-e Khomri\\nRoad from Kunduz to Pol-e Khomri – Driving in Afghanistan\\nOn the road from Kunduz to Pol-e Khomri I got spectacular landscapes. Great desert mountains in brownish tones. Rivers with small oasis. I really enjoyed this journey that followed until Pol-e Khomri crossing Baghlan, a city where I stopped to buy water and an Afghan SIM card for my phone. This trip was about 110km long.\\nWhen I went out in Baghlan, I bought some stuff, and all the people followed me with their eyes. I guess I felt even more watched than in Kunduz. Either way, people are generally very friendly.\\nNOTE: The road after Pol-e Khomri split in two. Turning right it continued for 188km until Mazar-e Sharif and driving straight it followed to Kabul, around 225km away.\\nRoad from Pol-e Khomri to Mazar-e Sharif\\nRoad from Pol-e Khomri to Mazar-e Sharif – Driving in Afghanistan\\nThe road from Pol-e Khomri to Mazar-e Sharif is beautiful. The landscapes are breathtaking, all with beautiful mountains and smooth tarmac in excellent condition.\\nI stopped for lunch in Aybak. I ate rice in a roadside restaurant. Afghan curiosity once again became an amazing experience. The people there wanted to know me and we all took photos together.\\nThe road to Aybak is breathtaking and looks like what we would expect to be Afghanistan. The ideal image of this country.\\nKholm is an ancient city located in the Fertile Crescent of the River Khulm delta. As such, it is a place of rich agriculture and densely populated, something that I observed during my passage through this region. The surrounding mountains are stunning and without a doubt the Gorge Tashkurgan is impressive. Just before reaching Kholm, a castle called Darwaza Khona creates a fabulous scenery within the surrounding mountains.\\nNOTE: This section of the route from Pol-e Khomri to Mazar-e Sharif is about 200km. It is good and offers no significant problems. While entering Mazar, they were constructing a new gate to the city.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['DWIN CASTLE IRAQ\\nThere are those kinds of places that are able to trigger our inner adventure instincts. You know, those places we get so hypnotically focused on exploring that we somehow lose the sense of time and space. Welcome to the idyllic Dwin Castle, located in a mountainous region at about 60km northeast of Erbil, in Northern Iraq.\\nIt was a rainy morning when I went out of Erbil and heading towards Rawanduz. I somehow felt that due to the weather, the day would not be enjoyable.\\nOn the map, I had pinpointed two castles, which I almost took out to go straight to Rawanduz and skip the dark, cloudy day. But, I was already driving on a secondary road, and going back to the main road would take me back to Erbil, so I ended up following the morning travel plan. The first surprise was the Dera Fort, with a beautiful view over the surrounding low mountains.\\nBut further north the road, everything changed when I arrived at Dwin Castle. As the rain got stronger I just couldn’t believe my eyes, of such an impressive beauty, that made me go and explore this fantastic ancient site. The encircling landscapes are amazing.\\nDWIN CASTLE KURDISTAN IRAQ\\n“Dwin Castle is supposed to have belonged to Jalaluddin, the grandfather of the famous Saladin, who amassed an enormous Muslim army to fight the European Crusaders out of the Levant.”\\nSaladin sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Hejaz, and Yemen. In 1187 and under his leadership, his forces subjugated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin, leading the way to the capture of Palestine and Jerusalem.\\nThe castle was built on a high place that covers an area of land of a one-square-kilometer. The date of its construction goes back to the Principality of Soran somewhere around the 10th century when it was set to be the princedom’s capital. From this fact comes the name Dwin which means “the capital”.\\nDwin Castle turns out to be a significant Kurdish historic site in Northern Iraq where we can still visit three old lookout towers, elements of the outline wall, various door frames, and a cemetery.\\nHaving the possibility of exploring the hometown and castle of Saladin Ayoubi is quite interesting historically. Near the castle, there is a peculiar graveyard, with unusual tombstones. One of the graves is said to be one of Saladin’s wives.\\nThe easy way to visit Dwin Castle is to go on an Iraq Kurdistan Region Tour with the fortress included on its 12-day itinerary around the northern part of Iraq.\\nThe surrender of Jerusalem to Salahuddin\\nPhotos of Dwin Castle\\nNOTE: I’ve been to Iraq three times. The first time back in 2010, the second time at the beginning of 2016, and the third time just recently in 2018 traveling for one month driving my campervan. Throughout recent years, Iraq has become safer, and there are many areas that can be visited without any issues.

       " ['Wild Beasts Encounter – Feeding Hyenas in Ethiopia\\nClank! That was the sound of Africa’s second strongest bite in close contact with my ear. For a quick moment, it actually crossed my mind the possibility of losing it.\\nEthiopia is an amazing country and after two weeks I discovered a place of ancient history, beautiful and friendly people, good food and amazing scenery.\\nDuring my travel to Ethiopia, I got to visit Harar, a sacred Muslim city said to be the fourth holiest city of Islam. Yes, I was feeding wild hyenas in Ethiopia – East Africa.\\nThe Fortified Historic Town of Harar by day\\nHarar is situated on a hill of the Ethiopian plateau eastern extension about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa. Apart from its historical spirituality related heritage, Harar is famous in Ethiopia for its hyenas’ feeding rituals.\\nFeeding Hyenas in Ethiopia\\nHyenas Feeding Ritual in Ethiopia\\nHyenas in Ethiopia – The ritual\\n“During the night, among Harar’s 82 mosques and 102 shrines inside the walled city, we can listen to the creeping sound of the hyenas laughing, howling, and running up and down the tiny streets.”\\nLegend says that spirits, called djinns, live in the nearby mountains. The wild hyenas come down to feed themselves in the city. It is believed that while they are fed by humans, they somehow lose interest in children. If by chance one day the hyenas don’t come down, something bad will happen, the local hyena feeder told me. For a close encounter with these wild beasts, you have to come to Harar.\\nLocal superstition reports that these hyenas exorcise people from bad spirits. So Ethiopians from around the region come to perform this ceremony. The mysticism of the hyenas is also somehow merged with the mysticism of wolves, as being night creatures. In Amharic language, the word for hyena djibb, derives from the Arabic word dhib, meaning wolf.\\nRight after sunset, a group of initiated men – the hyenas’ whisperers – call the animals to be fed. Foreign visitors can also join, paying for the meat and the whisperer’s friendliness.\\nSoon, a dozen hungry, curious and suspiciously scared hyenas start to come close to the people near the hyena feeder. Hyenas are very interesting animals, and, locally associated with spirits, they do seem to be under some kind of spell.\\nWild Beasts Encounter – Feeding Hyenas in Ethiopia\\nFeeding Hyenas in Ethiopia\\nThe Hyena Whisperer will give you a wooden skewer loaded with meat to hold between your teeth, from which the hyena will come to feed. Unexpectedly he positions another meat skewer close to your ear. After the massive hyena fearlessly comes to eat, literally inches from your ear – you can feel its warm breath, smell the intense animal scent and hear it chomping loud while it devours the meat.\\nAlthough this practice of feeding hyenas has been done for a couple of centuries, it has been only since the 50’s that Harar’s population “institutionalized” this practice, and several people from around the city are actually funding this intriguing yet remarkable practice.\\nNOTE: Did you know that humans have a 54kg / 120lb bite pressure, domestic dogs have a 145kg / 320lb, lions have a 272kg / 600lb, white sharks have a 281kg / 620lb and hyenas have a 453kg / 1000lb powerful bite. That’s incredible.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nFlags of Africa – National Flags\\nMeaning of the Flags of Africa\\nThe flags represent the national identity of each country in Africa. Each flag color has a meaning in the history of each nation. African flags vary on color, shape, and meaning. On this page, I list all flags of Africa with their meaning and color explanation.\\nCopyright: I own the copyright usage of these images. You cannot use text or image without permission.\\nAfrica National Flags\\nFlag of Algeria\\nFlag of Algeria\\n3 colors: white, green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Algeria: The red star and the crescent represent the religion, Islam. White symbolizes peace and honesty; green symbolizes the beauty of nature, hope, and joy; red symbolizes the blood of those killed fighting for independence in the Algerian War (1954 to 1962). The green on the Algerian flag also symbolizes the state religion of Islam.\\nHistory of the Flag of Algeria\\nThe flag of Algeria is divided into two areas: green on the left and white on the right. In the center, there is a Crescent Moon around a five-point star, both in red. Green is a natural choice, for it’s the color of Islam, and white represents purity.\\nIn the 19th-century, a white flag was already the symbol used by Abd al-Qadir, who was an Algerian turned national hero when he resisted the French. The red of the Crescent Moon and the star stand for the blood the Algerians shed while fighting against the European invaders.\\nThis has been the national flag since the country’s independence in 1962 and was inspired by the flag of FLN (National Liberation Front), the movement that fought the French presence in Algeria and that still is the leading political party in the country.\\nFlag of Angola\\nFlag of Angola\\n3 colors: red, black, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Angola: One star represents international solidarity and development; machete represents the farmers, the agriculture process, and armed fight; cog wheel represents the workers and the industrial process. Red symbolizes the blood against the colonizers; black symbolizes the African continent; yellow symbolizes the natural resources.\\nHistory of the Flag of Angola\\nThe flag of Angola was adopted in 1975, after the country’s independence. It’s split evenly into two horizontal areas: top red and bottom black. The first represents the blood shed during the war for independence, and the latter represents the African continent as a whole and the black people.\\nIn the center, there are three yellow elements: a five-point star, slightly small, encircled by a part of a cog-wheel and a katana. Those are communist symbols that reflect the ideological influence of the main political party in Angola, MPLA, which in 1975 was affiliated with the Soviet Union. The star represents socialism, and the cog-wheel and the katana represent the national industry and agriculture. The yellow represents the country’s mineral wealth. In fact, the current flag is primarily influenced by the one of the political party, to which they only added the cog-wheel and the katana.\\nIn 1996 and then in 2003 new flags were thought for Angola, but none of the projects came through.\\nFlag of Benin\\nFlag of Benin\\n3 colors: yellow, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Benin: Green symbolizes hope and the southern palm groves; red symbolizes the blood and courage of those who fought for Dahomey and yellow represents the natural resources and the northern savannas. All the colors represent the pan African spirit.\\nHistory of the Flag of Benin\\nAs it happens with most African countries, Benin’s current flag was adopted when the country gained independence from France in 1960. The flag is divided into three different areas. The first vertical third of the flag is green. The other two thirds, both horizontal, are yellow (top) and red (bottom).\\nWhy those colors? Because those are the colors of the Pan-African movement: the green stands for hope, the yellow stands for prosperity, and the red stands for the people’s bravery and the blood shed during the wars for liberation.\\nBetween 1975 and 1990, the country had a Marxist-based government that changed the nation’s official name to the Republic of Dahomey. At that time, the flag was green with a red star in the top left corner.\\nFlag of Botswana\\nFlag of Botswana\\n3 colors: blue, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Botswana: Blue symbolizes water; white and black alternate stripes represent the ethnic harmony of the country and the liberal nature of society. The stripes symbolize the skin of the zebra, the national animal of Botswana.\\nHistory of the Flag of Botswana\\nThe flag of Botswana was adopted after the country’s independence in 1966. The primary color is a very particular shade of blue, almost grayish. There’s a black stripe with a white border in the middle across the flag.\\nThere isn’t specific information about the meaning of the flag and its colors. One of the theories links the blue to the need for rain, which people refers to as Setswana (let the rain come). The black and white could represent a zebra, Botswana’s national animal.\\nOn the other hand, the three colors could represent the ethnic diversity of the country and the wish for peaceful coexistence.  \\nFlag of Burkina Faso\\nFlag of Burkina Faso\\n3 colors: red, green, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Burkina Faso: Red represents the revolution; green represents the country’s profusion of natural resources. The yellow star symbolizes the guiding illumination of the revolt.\\nHistory of the Flag of Burkina Faso\\nThe flag of Burkina Faso has two horizontal stripes, the top one is red, and the bottom one is green, and a five-point yellow star in the middle.\\nAlthough the colors are the same as the Pan-African movement, there is an official explanation that interprets the color choice differently. The red represents the socialist revolution and the green symbolizes Burkina Faso’s natural wealth. The colors also represent camaraderie among African countries. The star represents the guiding light of the socialist revolution.\\nThis country was a French colony until 1960 and only adopted the current flag and the current name (it used to be called the Republic of Upper Volta) in 1984. Burkina Faso means “land of the upright men” in the local language.\\nFlag of Burundi\\nFlag of Burundi\\n3 colors: red, green, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Burundi: The stars in a triangular arrangement refer to the National motto of Burundi: “Unity, Work, and Progress”. The stars also symbolize the three ethnic groups in the country: the Hutu, Tutsi and the Twa. White represents peace, green stands for optimism and hope; red symbolizes the bloodshed of the soldiers in the struggle for independence.\\nHistory of the Flag of Burundi\\nThe flag of Burundi is very distinguishing. In the center, a white circle overlays a horizontal X, also white, that crosses the whole of the flag. Inside the circle, there are three stars, red with green edges, laid in a triangle. The four segments created by the horizontal X are green (on the sides) and red (top and bottom).\\nThe meaning of the stars in the center of the circle is not consensual. They could represent the three ethnicities living in Burundi (Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa), or the three words in the national motto: Unity, Work, and Progress.\\nThe green means hope in the future and red symbolizes the blood shed during the fights for the country’s independence. As for the white, it represents peace.\\nBurundi became independent from Belgium in 1962 and adopted a flag similar to the current one. The only difference was the karyenda inside the circle, a drum with divine powers that broadcasted messages that only the king could receive. After the monarchy was abolished in 1966, the flag was changed and temporarily included the representation of sorghum, a plant that is essential for the country’s economy. The final and current version was adopted on 28 June 1967.\\nFlag of Cape Verde\\nFlag of Cape Verde\\n4 colors: blue, white, red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Cape Verde (Cabo Verde): Blue symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean; white represents peace. The ten golden stars represent the ten islands in this country. The red strip which passes through the white horizontal patch symbolizes economic progress.\\nHistory of the Flag of Cape Verde\\nThe current flag in Cabo Verde was adopted on 22 September 1992, replacing the one that was chosen in 1975 when the country gained independence. That flag was green, red, and yellow, the colors of the Pan-African movement and of the PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde), the main political party.\\nCabo Verde’s current flag has a dark blue background and three horizontal stripes in the bottom half, one red in the middle and two white. There’s a circle with ten yellow five-point stars close to the bottom left of the flag that represent the ten islands of the Cape Verde archipelago.\\nThe primary blue stands for the vast of the Atlantic Ocean around the islands. The stripes stand for the country’s growth towards building the nation, the white represents peace, and the red represents effort.\\nFlag of Cameroon\\nFlag of Cameroon\\n3 colors: green, red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Cameroon: Yellow represents happiness; green symbolizes hope; the red background of the star is a representation of unity and so is the “star of unity”. All the colors represent the pan African spirit.\\nHistory of the Flag of Cameroon\\nThe three-color flag of Cameroon has three vertical stripes, from left to right, green, red, and yellow, and a yellow five-point star in the center.\\nThose are the colors of the Pan-African movement, and Cameroon was the second country to use them on their national flag. The green symbolizes the forests and the lush landscapes in the south, the yellow represents the sun and the vast savannahs in the north, and the red stands for unity. The star in the flag is also known as “the star of unity.”\\nAfter the country’s independence, the flag was slightly different. There were two stars instead of one, smaller and overlapping, in the top left corner (green side).\\nThe current flag was adopted on 20 May 1975.\\nFlag of Central African Republic (CAR)\\nFlag of Central African Republic\\n5 colors: blue, white, green, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Central African Republic: The red in the vertical stripe represents the blood spilt by the people to achieve independence. In the horizontal stripes, blue symbolizes the sky and freedom; white stands for peace and dignity; green represents hope and faith; yellow represents the tolerance and hospitality of the people. The yellow five-point star of independence on the top blue stripe symbolizes a bright future.\\nHistory of the Flag of Central African Republic\\nThe Central African Republic has one of the most colorful flags in the world. It has four horizontal stripes: dark blue, white, green, and yellow (top to bottom). There’s a red vertical stripe that crosses over the other four and a yellow five-point star in the top left corner.\\nThe red, white, and blue stand for the country’s colonial past, while the red together with green and yellow are the colors of the Pan-African movement and stand for the union between the continent’s countries.\\nThe vertical stripe also stands for the blood shed during the independence wars. The star is a common symbol in other African flags, and it stands for unity, progress, and tolerance.\\nThe flag was adopted on 1 December 1958 and designed by Barthélemy Boganda, the president at the time. This is how he explained the flag to the Legislative Assembly:\\n“Those colors, which symbolize the four territories of the French Equatorial Africa but also our guide territory, the Metropolitan France. The red stripe which crosses the four colors is the symbol of our blood. As we did it when France was in danger, we shall shed our blood for Africa and to protect the Central African Republic, member of the French Community.”\\nIn 1976, the country’s president Jean-Bédel Bokassa converted to Islam and tried to replace the flag but was quickly deposed. In December of that same year, a new Constitution confirmed the current flag as official.\\nFlag of Chad\\nFlag of Chad\\n3 colors: blue, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Chad: Blue represents the clear blue skies and the azure waters in the southern shores of Chad (hope and ambition); yellow represents the bright sunshine in Chad and also the sands of desert to the north of Chad; red symbolizes progress and unity and the sacrifice of the martyrs.\\nHistory of the Flag of Chad\\nThe flag of Chad is simple, with three colors and three vertical stripes: dark blue, yellow, and red (from left to right). It’s very similar to the Romanian flag, except the blue is darker.\\nThe design behind this flag was an attempt to combine the influence of the French flag with the colors of the Pan-African movement.\\nIts colors stand for the following: the blue represents sky and hope, the yellow represents the sun and the desert, and the red symbolizes the blood shed while fighting for independence.\\nThe flag was adopted on 6 November 1959 and, despite all political troubles, it’s been unchanged for decades perhaps because there is no symbolic connection to any of the political forces that fight for power in Chad.\\nFlag of Comoros Islands\\nFlag of Comoros\\n5 colors: yellow, white, red, blue, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Comoros: The crescent, stars, and the green color represent Islam. Yellow, white, red, and blue all symbolize the four islands of the country: Moheli, Mayotte, Anjouan, Grand Comore. The four stars represent these islands too.\\nHistory of the Flag of Comoros Islands\\nThe flag of this small African country, an archipelago between Madagascar and Mozambique, is quite colorful. It has four horizontal stripes: yellow, white, red, and blue (from top to bottom). On the left side, coming out of the flag’s edge is the base of a green triangle that stretches out almost until the middle. Inside that triangle, there’s a Crescent Moon and four five-point stars stacked vertically.\\nThe current flag is the last version of many others used by the Comoros Islands. The first one is from 1963, right before independence. It was completely green, with the four stars diagonally laid over the Crescent Moon in the top left corner. Different versions followed, all placing the same elements in various configurations.\\nThe current flag is the first one to include other colors besides green and red. It first appeared between 1976 and 1978 and was officially adopted on 7 January 2002.\\nThe four stripes represent the four islands in the archipelago, including the one that’s not part of the country: yellow for Mohéli, white for Mayotte (under French administration), red for Anjouan, and blue for Grande Comore.\\nIt has one white star for each island and the Crescent Moon represents the archipelago’s main religion Islam.\\nFlag of Democratic Republic of Congo\\nFlag of Democratic Republic of Congo\\n3 colors: blue, red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Democratic Republic of Congo: Red symbolizes the sacrifices of the national heroes; yellow stands for the country’s wealth; blue represents peace and harmony. The star symbolizes hope and ambition for the future.\\nHistory of the Flag of Democratic Republic of Congo\\nThe flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a bright blue background, a red and yellow diagonal stripe across, and a yellow five-point star in the top left corner.\\nThe blue stands for peace, the red stands for the blood shed by patriots, and the yellow stands for prosperity. As for the star, it stands for the desire for a better future for the country. Although considering it’s similar to the one used by the Pan-African movement, the star might also represent the union between that continent’s countries.\\nWhen the Democratic Republic of the Congo became independent from Belgium in 1960, it was called Zaire and its first flag was based on the colors of Pan-Africanism, green, yellow, and red. However, the flag was changed after the 1996 revolution and the country adopted a blue flag with six stars and one more, larger, in the center.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 20 February 2006.\\nFlag of Djibouti\\nFlag of Djibouti\\n4 colors: blue, green, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Djibouti: Blue represents the clear blue skies and the clear waters of Djibouti; green symbolizes the earth and the country’s landscape; white is the color of peace and represents harmony. The red star represents unity in the culturally diverse country and also the areas where the Somalis live.\\nHistory of the Flag of Djibouti\\nThe flag of Djibouti has three areas: two horizontal stripes, light blue in the top and green in the bottom, and a white triangle on the left side with the base on the edge of the flag and the vertex pointing to the center. There’s a red five-point star laid over the triangle.\\nThis flag was inspired by the one of the Independence National League that once ruled Djibouti in 1977.\\nThe colors represent, in part, the tribes that live in the country: the Somali Issa frequently uses that blue shade and the Muslim Afar uses the green. On the other hand, the blue represents the sky, and the green represents the country’s landscapes.\\nThe white stands for peace and the red star is inspired by the Pan-African symbol that represents unity.\\nThe flag was hoisted for the first time on 29 June 1977.\\nFlag of Egypt\\nFlag of Egypt\\n3 colors: red, white, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Egypt: The Eagle of Saladin represents authority, beauty, and sovereignty. Red represents the period before the 1952 Revolution, marked by bloodshed and unrest; White symbolizes the bloodless revolution, which ended the monarchy and paved the way for Egypt’s transition into a republic; black symbolizes Egypt’s past, when the Egyptians were subjugated by the British, and the invincible spirit of the people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Egypt\\nThe flag of Egypt has three colors in three horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom. In the middle of the flag, centered, there’s the symbol of the eagle of Saladin.\\nWhite means the purity of feelings of the Egyptian people, black, on the bottom, symbolizes victory over darkness, and red means the blood that was shed at war in Egypt. The eagle was adopted as a national symbol of Egypt a long time ago, to honor Saladin’s role in ousting the Crusaders from the region.\\nThis flag has influenced a few other ones later created in countries like Syria, Sudan, Iraq, Yemen, and, for some time, Libya.\\nAlthough Egypt was only officially independent from the United Kingdom in 1922, there used to be a national flag before that, similar to the current flag of Turkey: all red with a white Crescent Moon and a star. After 1922, the country adopted a flag with a Crescent Moon and three stars over a green background. Those three stars symbolized the three main territories of the country: Egypt, Sudan, and Nubia. Some people claim the stars symbolized the country’s three main religious groups: Christians, Muslims, and Jewish.\\nThe military coup of 1953 ended the monarchy regime and the new government created the one we currently know as the Egyptian flag, although it kept the same previous flag. In 1958, that revolutionary flag was adopted as the national flag, but instead of the eagle of Saladin, it had two green stars in the center. At that time there was a brief union between Egypt and Syria, and that is the same flag used in Syria now. In 1972, the country adopted the final version of the flag, the one we know today.\\nFlag of Equatorial Guinea\\nFlag of Equatorial Guinea\\n4 colors: green, white, red, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Equatorial Guinea: Green symbolizes the luxuriant vegetation and the fertility of crops; white stands for peace and harmony in which the country lives; red represents the blood spilt by the patriotic fighters for independence; blue symbolizes the clear pure waters of the infinite sea which connects Equatorial Guinea’s islands. The national coat of arms in the white stripe is a shield with a silk cotton tree, “God’s tree,”, representing the historical link between Equatorial Guinea and Spain. The tree has six yellow stars over it, which represent the mainland and the five main islands of the nation: Annobon, Bioko, Corisco, Great Elobey and Small Elobey. Under the shield containing the tree, we can read the words “Unidad, Paz Justicia” – “Unity Peace Justice”.\\nHistory of the Flag of Equatorial Guinea\\nThe flag of Equatorial Guinea has three horizontal stripes, one top green, one middle white, and one bottom red. On the left side, the base of a triangle that stretches toward the center, but without reaching the middle of the flag as it happens with other flags using the same design.\\nIn the center of the flag, over the white stripe, there’s the national symbol: a common tree in the country with five golden five-point stars on top laid in a semi-circle. Underneath, the motto “Unidad, Paz, Justicia” (Equatorial Guinea is the only country in Africa with Spanish for an official language).\\nThe stars represent the national territory: four islands and the mainland. The blue (in the triangle) symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean, green symbolizes the primary color of Equatorial Guinea’s landscapes, white symbolizes peace, and red symbolizes the blood that was shed during the independence war.\\nThis flag was first adopted on Independence Day, 12 October 1968, but when Francisco Nguema was president (1973-1979) the national symbol was different. Therefore, the current flag was adopted on 21 August 1979.\\nFlag of Eritrea\\nFlag of Eritrea\\n4 colors: green, red, blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Eritrea: The olive branch symbolizes peace and has been borrowed from the flag of the United Nations. Green represents the country’s natural beauty, lush greenery, and fertility; blue symbolizes the vast oceans and seas, particularly the Red Sea; red represents the noble patriotic spirit displayed by the martyrs during the fight for independence; yellow symbolizes the abundance of minerals in Eritrea.\\nHistory of the Flag of Eritrea\\nThe flag of Eritrea has three distinct areas. They’re basically three triangles: one with the base covering all the left side and with the vertex stretching towards the center of the opposite side. This one is red and shaped kind of like the country. The other two triangles, both of them orthogonal, have their bases on each half of the right side of the flag: green on top and blue in the bottom.\\nOn the left side of the flag, over the red triangle, there’s a symbol with an olive branch encircled by a wreath made with leaves of the same tree. This symbol was inspired by the former flag of Eritrea, that had these symbols to honor the United Nations.\\nThe red symbolizes the blood that was shed for the country’s independence, the blue symbolizes the ocean, and there’s also a connection to the UN flag, and green symbolizes the fields of Eritrea.\\nEritrea became independent, with the help and support of the United Nations, in 1952. But the country’s autonomy ended ten years later after a civil war, when Ethiopia annexed Eritrea, ironically with the help of the United Nations.\\nEritrea regained independence in 1993 and has been using the current flag ever since, with a slight variation in proportion. The new flag was hoisted for the first time on 24 May 1993.\\nFlag of Ethiopia\\nFlag of Ethiopia\\n4 colors: green, yellow, red, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ethiopia: Green represents hope and fertility of the land; yellow symbolizes harmony for Ethiopian people; red symbolizes valor and war in the struggle for independence and resistance to colonist takeover. The yellow five-pointed star symbolizes the future of the country and possibly also King Solomon and the Star of David. The five yellow rays around the star represent equality of the various people in Ethiopia.\\nHistory of the Flag of Ethiopia\\nThe flag of Ethiopia includes the distinctive colors of Pan-Africanism: green, yellow, and red, from top to bottom. The national symbol, in the center over the yellow stripe, is a yellow pentagram with five sunbeams over a blue circle. The emblem represents equality between all Ethiopians but also their diversity. The blue is linked to peace, and the beams are connected to prosperity.\\nRegarding the color scheme, it not only relates to Pan-Africanism, but Ethiopia was the inspiration for the movement to adopt those colors. However, the reason why the colors green, yellow, and red were chosen to become the national colors of Ethiopia was never determined. Some say the rainbow was a source of inspiration because it’s such a frequent phenomenon at the Blue Nile waterfalls.\\nIn the flag, green can symbolize the lands of Ethiopia, yellow symbolizes peace, and red symbolizes strength.\\nThe same colors were already present in older flags before this official one. King Melik II ordered, on 6 October 1897, the creation of a national flag, with the same horizontal stripes, except the red was on top. Since then, that national symbol has been through several periods of change: under Emperor Haile Selassie, after his death, during the Derg regime, during the transition period, and finally on 31 October 1996 (when the current flag was adopted).\\nFlag of Gabon\\nFlag of Gabon\\n3 colors: green, yellow, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Gabon: Green represents the natural resources of the forests; yellow symbolizes the equator, which passes through the country, as well as the minerals found in Gabon (mainly gold), and the bright and warm sunshine; blue stands for the crystal clear waters of the Atlantic shore.\\nHistory of the Flag of Gabon\\nThe flag of Gabon has three colors in three horizontal stripes: green on top, yellow in the middle, and blue in the bottom.\\nGabon became independent from France in 1960 and has kept true to the flag adopted at that time, which includes the green and yellow of the Pan-African movement. A movement that was inspired by the colors of the Ethiopian flag. The blue, even though it’s in a different shade from the one used in the French flag, is believed to be a reference to the colonial past.\\nThe green symbolizes the Gabon forests and the wood industry, yellow symbolizes the sun and the country’s location at zero latitude, and the blue symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean and the national rivers, especially Ogowe River.\\nAlthough the national flag has been unchanged since it was adopted on 9 August 1960, it’s based on an older model created one year earlier. It included the same colors but also a small French flag in the top left corner, just like it happens with the flag of Australia and other countries with the Union Jack.\\nFlag of Gambia\\nFlag of Gambia\\n4 colors: red, blue, green, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Gambia: Red represents the savanna grasslands and also the sun; blue symbolizes the waters of the Gambia River; green represents the wild plants, agriculture and the forests of Gambia. The two white stripes represent peace, unity and harmony.\\nHistory of the Flag of Gambia\\nThe flag of the Gambia has three horizontal stripes with two thinner white lines separating them. On the top, a red stripe that symbolizes the intense sunshine in the country’s savannahs. In the middle, a narrower blue stripe that represents the Gambia River, a geographical trait that was crucial to building this country since it basically grew alongside the river’s course. The green in the bottom symbolizes the national fields and lush green vegetation of the Gambia. The white, in the thin lines, symbolizes union and peace.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 18 February 1965 when the country became independent from the United Kingdom. It’s been unchanged ever since, despite the different political changes that included a seven-year union with Senegal (1982-1989). When the Gambia became independent, there was a national public competition to choose the flag for the new country. Louis Thomasi, an accountant, was the winner and the creator of the flag.\\nFlag of Ghana\\nFlag of Ghana\\n4 colors: red, yellow, green, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ghana: Red symbolizes the revolutionary spirit and the sacrifices of the country’s martyrs fighting for independence; yellow represents the abundance of minerals in Ghana; green symbolizes the natural resources like the forests in the country. The black star with five points represents the emancipation of Ghana and the unity and patriotic spirit of the people who fought colonialism.\\nHistory of the Flag of Ghana\\nGhana became independent from the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 and immediately adopted the current flag, although it was changed countless times until it went back to the original template. Ghana was the first country to use the three colors of the Pan-African movement in its flag.\\nThe flag’s three horizontal stripes are, top to bottom, red, yellow, and green. There’s a black five-point star in the center, over the yellow stripe.\\nThe flag was designed by Theodosia Okoh and chosen by the first president of the country, Kwame Nkrumah.\\nThe designer said: “I decided to use these three colors, red, yellow, and green, because of Ghana’s geography. Ghana is a tropical country blessed with rich vegetation. The yellow is inspired in our land’s mineral richness and the red honors all of those who worked and died for the country’s independence. As for the five-point star, it’s a symbol of African emancipation and fight against colonialism.”\\nBetween 1958 and 1961, the flag was changed to include two black stars, a symbol of the short-lived political union with Guinea. After Mali joined this union, between 1961 and 1964, a third star was added. Between 1964 and 1966, yellow was replaced with white, but on 28 February 1966 Ghana returned to the original flag.\\nFlag of Guinea\\nFlag of Guinea\\n3 colors: red, yellow, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Guinea: Red represents the blood of the martyrs in the fight for independence and the work of all workers in the country; yellow symbolizes the riches of mineral resources, especially gold, and the sun that shines in Guinea; green represents the natural resources of the country, as well as prosperity and the fertile land of the country.\\nHistory of the Flag of Guinea\\nGuinea became independent from France in 1958 and immediately adopted the same flag that’s in use today.\\nMaybe inspired by the French flag, they chose a three-color flag with vertical stripes, from left to right, red, yellow, and green. Those are the colors of the Pan-African movement, the colors that Ghana had used in its national flag one year earlier.\\nThis flag is similar to the former flag of Rwanda that, because of the similarities, used the letter R in the center.\\nIn addition to the universal symbolism of the colors, that represent the union between all African people, president Sékou Touré said this was the meaning of the flag’s colors: red symbolizes the blood that was shed in the fight for independence, yellow symbolizes the sun and the richness of Guinea’s subsoil, and green symbolizes the lush vegetation in the country.\\nThe flag was officially adopted on 10 November 1958.\\nFlag of Guinea-Bissau\\nFlag of Guinea-Bissau\\n4 colors: yellow, red, green, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Guinea-Bissau: Red represents the blood spilt by the people who fought for independence from Portugal; yellow symbolizes the abundance of minerals in the country the bright sunshine heating up Guinea-Bissau; green stands for the abundant forests in the country, agriculture also symbolizes the hope to do better.\\nHistory of the Flag of Guinea-Bissau\\nThe flag of Guinea-Bissau was created just before the country’s independence on 24 September 1973, strongly inspired by the political party PAIGC (just as the Cape Verde flag) that rules the country today.\\nUnlike the usual layout of three-colored flags, that have three horizontal or vertical stripes, the flag of Guinea-Bissau is one-third red, on the left side, from top to bottom, with a black five-point star overlaid. The remaining two-thirds are two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and green in the bottom.\\nInfluenced by the flag of Ghana, the meaning of the colors is the same: red represents the blood that was shed during the fight for independence, yellow represents the sun and subsoil richness, and green symbolizes the primary color of the national landscape.\\nThe black star is a universal symbol in many African flags and represents the union between the continent’s people and different nations.\\nFlag of Ivory Coast\\nFlag of Ivory Coast\\n3 colors: orange, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ivory Coast (Cote d’Ivoire): Orange represents the land in the fertile areas in the savannahs of the north; white symbolizes joys and happiness and also represents the fresh water flowing in the rivers; green symbolizes the coastal forests, hope and a bright future.\\nHistory of the Flag of Ivory Coast\\nThe flag of Ivory Coast has three colors in vertical stripes: orange, white, and green, from left to right.\\nThe orange represents the country’s landscape main color, with lots of savannahs and deserts, while the white represents peace, national unity, and the rivers Sassandra, Bandama, and Kamo. The green represents hope in a better future and the lush landscapes of the south.\\nThe official meaning of the colors was formally defined on 3 December 1959 when the flag was adopted. At the time, the Minister of State Jean Delafosse stated that [the orange] “reminded the colors of our rich and generous land, the reason of our fight, the blood of the young people fighting for independence,” and that the white represented not only peace but the rightfully owned peace. The green would stand for hope and the assurance of a better future.\\nThe French flag might have influenced the current flag of this former colony, although it has a closer resemblance to the Irish flag: the same colors, but green on the left and orange on the right. The flag of Niger has the same colors, which is no surprise considering both countries’ collective past.\\nFlag of Kenya\\nFlag of Kenya\\n4 colors: black, red, green, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kenya: Black represents black majority in the country; red represents the blood spilt during the freedom fight; green stands for natural resources. The Maasai warrior shield with two spears protects all the above values.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kenya\\nThe flag of Kenya is quite distinctive with three colors in three horizontal stripes, top to bottom, black, red, and green, and two thinner white lines bordering the red stripe. In the center, covering portions of all three stripes, a traditional symbol with a Maasai shield and two crossed spears.\\nThe color choice of the flag of Kenya is not very common in Africa, where black is rarely used, and most countries prefer the green-yellow-red color scheme associated with the Pan-African movement.\\nBlack represents the country’s population, red represents the blood that was shed while fighting for independence, and green represents the primary color of the national landscapes. Just like we’ve seen in the flag of The Gambia, the white lines represent union and peace.\\nAnother interpretation of this flag, as we’ve seen with the flags of other African countries, is that these are the colors of Kenya’s leading political party, Kenya African National Union (KANU), and the white lines might represent the main opposition party, Kenyan African Democratic Union-Asili (KADU-ASIL).\\nThe weapons in the center of the flag symbolize the willingness of Kenya’s people to fight for their country.\\nThe flag was officially adopted on 12 December 1963, the day the country became independent from the United Kingdom.\\nFlag of Lesotho\\nFlag of Lesotho\\n4 colors: dark blue, white, green, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Lesotho: Blue symbolizes rain and water; white represents peace; green symbolizes prosperity. The Mokorotlo (the traditional Basotho straw hat) represents the indigenous Basotho (Southern Sotho) people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Lesotho\\nThe flag of Lesotho has a simple color scheme, with three horizontal stripes in blue (top), white (middle), and green (bottom). In the center, over the white stripe, there’s a black depiction of a traditional straw hat wore in the country called mokorotlo, that became the country’s national symbol.\\nBlue represents sky and rain, green represents prosperity, and white represents peace, something that Lesotho’s people care much about.\\nLesotho became independent in 1966 and it’s had several flags since then. The original flag, adopted that year, didn’t survive the military coup that overthrew the Basotho National Party in 1987, in power since independence. At that time a new flag appeared, designed by sergeant Retšelisitsoe Matete, with the same colors of the current flag but laid in a different order and with a military symbol instead of the mokorotlo.\\nIn 2006 Lesotho wanted to change the flag to remove the military symbol and convey a message of peace. All four proposals included the mokorotlo in brown, which was later switched to black to represent the country’s black population. The new flag was officially adopted on 4 October 2006.\\nFlag of Liberia\\nFlag of Liberia\\n3 colors: red, white, dark blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Liberia: Red and white symbolize the courage and moral excellence of the eleven signatories of the Liberian Declaration of Independence, represented by the eleven stripes.The white star stands for the freedom that the ex-slaves were given; the blue square represents the African mainland.\\nHistory of the Flag of Liberia\\nThe flag of Liberia is clearly influenced by the USA flag, a rare case in Africa. That is connected to the curious History of the lands that are now known as Liberia, which translates into “Land of Freedom.” They dreamed of the utopian return of former slaves and their descendants from the United States to Africa.\\nClaiming independence in 1847 (recognized by the USA in 1862), Liberia is one of the oldest countries in Africa but kept its emotional and political ties with the United States until the 20th century.\\nThe layout of the Liberian flag is the same as the USA one, with a few differences: there is a white five-point star in the top left corner, and 11 white and red stripes, unlike the 13 we see in the American flag.\\nThe symbolism is also different: the stripes represent the 11 people who signed the country’s declaration of independence, the red symbolizes courage, and the white represents excellence.\\nAs for the star, it represents Liberia as the first African independent country (the blue rectangle represents Africa) and the first with a Western-style democratic political model.\\nIt’s probably Africa’s oldest national flag, officially adopted on 26 July 1847. It’s a famous flag that you’ll see on thousands of ships, considering the country issues permits very quickly and with very appealing conditions.\\nFlag of Libya\\nFlag of Libya\\n4 colors: red, black, green, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Libya: Red stands for the blood of the Libyan people who died during the fascist rule of Italy; green represents peace. The crescent and star on a black background was inspired in the design of the banner used during the Senussi Dynasty, founded in Mecca in 1837.\\nHistory of the Flag of Libya\\nThe current flag of Libya has three horizontal stripes: red on top, a more full black stripe in the middle, and green on the bottom. In the center, a white five-point star and Crescent Moon laid over the black stripe.\\nAlthough it went through significant changes since the creation of the kingdom of Libya in 1951, the national flag has come full circle returning to its original concept, in 2011.\\nThe flag was inspired by the one used by the Senussi dynasty, from Cyrenaica, black and with a Crescent Moon and star.\\nIt wasn’t proved that the flag was created by Omar Faiek Shennib, the Vice-President of the National Assembly and Minister of Defense of King Idris Al Senussi. But it was him who first presented the concept.\\nAccording to Omar Faiek Shennib, the red symbolizes the blood that was shed during the fights for independence, black symbolizes the dark times when Italy ruled Libya, and green symbolizes the national agriculture industry. The Crescent Moon and the star are a reference to the Senussi dynasty and the importance of king Idris Al Senussi.\\nThe flag was used from the country’s inception until 1969 when the revolution led by Kadhaffi happened. Between that year and 1972, they used a three-color flag with the colors of the Pan-Arabism just like it had happened in Egypt in 1952. Between 1972 and 1977, the flag represented the union with Egypt and Syria, and between 1977 and 2011 the flag of Libya was totally green.\\nOn 17 February 2011, the first flag of independent Libya was officially adopted.\\nFlag of Madagascar\\nFlag of Madagascar\\n3 colors: white, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Madagascar: Red represents the sovereignty of the country; green symbolizes hope; white stands for purity.\\nHistory of the Flag of Madagascar\\nThe flag of Madagascar has three areas: one white on the left side taking over 1/3 of the flag, and 2/3 with two horizontal stripes (top red and bottom green).\\nInitially, the flag was mostly white as a tribute to the Merina dynasty and their effort to keep Madagascar’s independence at a time when the rest of the continent was conquered and controlled by Europeans. They resisted until 1866. The white represents purity and chastity, red represents the country’s independence, and green represents Madagascar’s people hope in a better future.\\nAnother interpretation claims the green represents the population living by the coast, white represents the Volafot clan, and red represents the Volamen clan.\\nThe flag was officially adopted on 14 October 1958, two years before the independence, and hasn’t been changed since.\\nFlag of Malawi\\nFlag of Malawi\\n3 colors: black, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Malawi: Black represents the African people; red symbolizes the blood spilt for their independence struggle; green stands for the country’s fertile lands. The rising sun over the black background symbolizes freedom and hope of the people in the African continent.\\nHistory of the Flag of Malawi\\nThe flag of Malawi has three horizontal stripes: one black stripe in the top (with a symbol of a rising sun overlaid in the center), one red in the middle, and one green in the bottom.\\nThe black stripe symbolizes the country’s people, the red represents the blood that was shed in the fight for independence, and the green represents the lush vegetation in Malawi.\\nAs for the sun with 31 beams, it has a double meaning: it symbolizes the birth of a new nation and the bright future ahead, and it’s a reference to the meaning of the name of the country. Malawi is the word for the natural effect that happens over the Lake Nyasa when the sun sets.\\nThe flag was inspired by the flag of the country’s leading political party, Malawi Congress Party.\\nThe flag was adopted on 6 July 1964, on Independence Day, and although it was changed in 2010, it returned to its original design in 2012.\\nFlag of Mali\\nFlag of Mali\\n3 colors: green, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Mali: Green represents the vegetation of Mali; yellow stands for purity and minerals in the country; red symbolizes the fight for independence.\\nHistory of the Flag of Mali\\nThe flag of Mali is simple to describe: it’s a three-color flag with vertical stripes, green on the left, yellow in the middle, and red on the right. Those are the colors of the Pan-African movement where green symbolizes the forests and the land’s fertility, yellow represents the sun, and red represents the fight for independence.\\nWhen Mali became independent from France in 1960, it joined a political union with Sudan and Senegal, starting a federation. At the time the flag was similar to the current one, with an anthropomorphic symbol in the middle called Kanaga.\\nIn 1961, when the federation ended, Mali adopted the current flag, on 1 March of that year. The Kanaga was removed from the flags of the federation’s former countries because there was an ideological conflict between Muslim’s religious beliefs and the use of a human figure in a flag.\\nFlag of Mauritania\\nFlag of Mauritania\\n2 colors: green, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Mauritania: Green represents Islam, as well as the star and crescent, which shows the faith of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\\nHistory of the Flag of Mauritania\\nThe flag of Mauritania is mostly green, with one red stripe in the top and one in the bottom, and a yellow Crescent Moon and five-point star in the middle. However, unlike what happens in other flags with this Islamic symbol, in the Mauritania flag, the Crescent Moon is laid horizontally, with the tips of the moon pointing up.\\nAccording to some authors, the green symbolizes the country’s growth and bright future, while yellow represents Mauritania’s deserts.\\nThe flag combines elements of the Pan-African movement, the colors yellow, red, and green, and religious elements (the symbols and the color green, the color of Islam).\\nThe current flag was officially adopted on 15 August 2017, replacing the old flag that didn’t include the red stripes and that was used since the country’s independence, chosen at the time by president Moktar Ould Daddah.\\nThe replacement took place after a national referendum promoted by president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.\\nThe red stripes symbolize the efforts and the sacrifice of the people of Mauritania when defending their country.\\nFlag of Mauritius\\nFlag of Mauritius\\n4 colors: red, blue, yellow, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Mauritius: Red symbolizes the spilt blood during the freedom fight; blue stands for the Indian Ocean on which the island is located; yellow represents the golden ray of freedom; green symbolizes greenery and agriculture in Mauritius.\\nHistory of the Flag of Mauritius\\nThe flag of Mauritius has four horizontal stripes: red in the top, blue and yellow in the middle, and green in the bottom.\\nIt’s the same color scheme as the Pan-African movement, but it’s most likely a coincidence considering these are the same colors used in the islands’ coat of arms, given by King Edward VII in 1906.\\nThe red symbolizes the fight for freedom and independence, the blue symbolizes the Indian Ocean that encircles the Mauritius islands, the yellow symbolizes the light brought by sovereignty, and the green symbolizes the country’s agriculture and landscape.\\nThe flag was designed by an elementary school teacher, Gurudutt Moher, and adopted on Independence Day, 12 March 1968.\\nFlag of Morocco\\nFlag of Morocco\\n2 colors: red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Morocco: The red color in the flag has several important meanings for Morocco: it symbolizes the royals, including the Alaouite family, rulers in the seventeenth century, the Sherifs of Mecca and the Imams of Yemen. Red also represents the bravery and strength of the Moroccan people. The green five-pointed star is a pentagram symbolizing religion.\\nHistory of the Flag of Morocco\\nThe flag of Morocco is red, with a green pentagram in the center, known as the “Seal of Solomon.”\\nThe red, the primary color of the flag, symbolizes the blood union between prophet Mohamed and the king of Morocco, but it could also be interpreted as a representation of independence and the country’s sovereignty.\\nThe red flag was adopted in the 17th century and the pentagram was added in 1915, during the kingdom of Mulay Yusef, as a symbol of love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, and the five pillars of Islam. The current flag was officially adopted on 17 November 1915 and remained the same even under Spanish and French ruling.\\nFlag of Mozambique\\nFlag of Mozambique\\n5 colors: green, red, black, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Mozambique: Green represents the land; white stands for peace; black represents the African continent; yellow stands for the mineral wealth of the nation. The red triangle symbolizes the immense effort for independence.

There’s a red triangle on the left, with the base covering all the left side and the vertex stretching out to one-third of the flag.\\nOver that red triangle, laid over a yellow five-point star, there’s a symbol of an AK-47 Kalashnikov assault rifle and bayonet that was the weapon of choice of the revolutionaries in the 1960s and the 1970s. There’s a hoe laid over the rifle that represents the Mozambican farmers and a book underneath representing the importance of education.\\nThe flag was inspired by FRELIMO, the political party that organized the armed fight for Mozambique’s independence.\\nThe green symbolizes the country’s fertile lands, black symbolizes the people of Mozambique, and yellow represents the mineral richness. The white represents peace.\\nBefore the independence, that happened in 1975, the country chose a flag with the same layout but without the symbols over the red triangle. After the independence, they kept the colors but laid them differently and used the same symbols we see in the flag now. The current flag was officially adopted on 1 May 1983.\\nIn 2005, there was a substantial change made to the flag, with a public competition that attracted 119 entries. The opposing party in the parliament wanted to remove the weapon symbol from the flag (there are only two other countries in the world with weapons in their flags), but FRELIMO impaired the change.\\nFlag of Namibia\\nFlag of Namibia\\n3 colors: yellow, green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Namibia: Blue represents the vast sky, rain and water; white signifies tranquility and harmony; green symbolizes plant growth and cultivation; red is for the valor of the Namibian people and their wish for people to be equals.

There were 870 applications for the public competition to choose the flag of the new country. Six designs made it to the finalists and of those, the proposals of those three men were selected. From then, they combined the concepts of all three designs into one flag, the one we know today. Two other plaintiffs lost the case.\\nFlag of Niger\\nFlag of Niger\\n3 colors: orange, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Niger: Orange symbolizes the Savannah grasslands in the northern regions of the Sahara Desert; white stands for purity and innocence; green represents the rainforests and the Niger River. The orange circle in the middle of the white stripe represents the celestial sun and the will of the state to protect its freedom.\\nHistory of the Flag of Niger\\nThe flag of Niger was defined one year before the country’s independence. It has three horizontal stripes: orange in the top, white in the middle, and light green in the bottom.

The public competition was organized in 1959 and it got over 200 applications.\\nThe flag designed by Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi had an additional symbol, a sun laid over the white central stripe.\\nThere are two main interpretations of this flag. One claims the white represents Niger River, surrounded by the green Nigerian landscapes. Another one claims the white represents peace and green represents the country’s agricultural tradition.\\nThe flag was adopted on Nigeria’s Independence Day, 1 October 1960.\\nFlag of Republic of Congo\\nFlag of Republic of Congo\\n3 colors: green, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of the Republic of Congo: The colors green, yellow and red are the traditional Pan-African colors: green symbolizes agriculture and forests; yellow symbolises the friendship and nobility of the people; red stands for the struggle for independence.\\nHistory of the Flag of the Republic of Congo\\nThe flag of the Republic of the Congo has two primary colors, green on the left and red on the right, and a diagonal yellow stripe across, from left to right.\\nThis set of colors corresponds to the Pan-African movement and symbolize the union between African people.

Surprisingly, there’s no official interpretation for the red.\\nThe current flag was adopted for the first time on 15 September 1959, after they became independent from France. However, between 1970 and 1991, under the regime supported by the Soviet Union, the flag was completely red with communist symbols.

There’s a sun in the top right corner, an unusual place to lay symbols in a flag.\\nThe blue represents peace and happiness, yellow represents hope in a better future and economic development, and green represents prosperity and the country’s natural resources.\\nThe sun symbolizes light, literally, and enlightenment, figuratively.\\nThis flag was adopted on 25 October 2001, after Rwanda’s dark period when the Hutu majority slaughtered a large number of people of the Tutsi tribe. The former flag, used since the independence in 1961, was the same as the flag of Guinea but with the letter R in the center to tell them apart.\\nThe flag was designed by Alphonse Kirimobenecyo, who intended for the flag to represent the movement of reconciliation after the massacres. It conveys the principles of national union, respect for work, heroism, and trust in the future.\\nFlag of Saint Thomas and Prince\\nFlag of Saint Thomas and Prince\\n4 colors: green, yellow, red, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Saint Thomas and Prince: Green, yellow and black are pan-African colors and also the colors of the Liberation Movement. The red triangle represents the hard fight for independence. The two black stars represent the two main islands of the country.\\nHistory of the Flag of Saint Thomas and Prince\\nThe flag of Sao Tome and Principe has three horizontal stripes: yellow in the middle, and green in the top and bottom. On the left, a triangle laid horizontally with the vertex pointing to the middle of the flag. In the middle, laid over the yellow stripe, two black five-point stars.\\nThere is an obvious connection to the Pan-African movement, that uses green, red, and yellow as a symbol of union between the African people and nations. But, in the specific case of Sao Tome and Principe, the green also represents the lush vegetation that covers all the islands in the archipelago and the yellow represents sun and cocoa, the country’s main product. The red honors the memory of those who fought for the independence of Sao Tome and Principe and is connected to the principle of equality.\\nThe two stars represent the two islands that make up the country, but there’s also a connection with the Pan-Africanism star and its meaning of union.\\nThe flag of Sao Tome and Principe was adopted on 5 November 1975, after a long process of refusing all the proposals made for the flag of the new country. The one selected is almost identical to the leading political party in the country, MLSTP (Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe), and it was most likely designed by Manuel Pinto da Costa, historical leader of the MLSTP, who became president of Sao Tome and Principe.\\nFlag of Senegal\\nFlag of Senegal\\n3 colors: green, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Senegal: All the colors are pan-African ones. Green represents Islam, progress and hope; yellow stands for the natural wealth and progress of the Senegal, which will be obtained by the collective work of people; red is for the African peoples’ struggle for independence. The star represents unity and hope.\\nHistory of the Flag of Senegal\\nThe flag of Senegal has three vertical stripes in three colors: green in the left, yellow in the middle, and red in the right. In the center, laid over the yellow stripe, a green five-point star.\\nAs it happens with many other African countries, the colors of the flag of Senegal are the ones from the Pan-African movement, which got the same colors from the flag of Ethiopia, the only country in Africa that, despite being invaded and occupied by Italy, was never colonized.\\nIn addition to that common meaning, the green represents the vegetation but also the influence of Islam in Senegal, and the yellow represents the sun, the arts, and the quality of life. As for the red, it symbolizes the blood that was shed during the fight for independence. The green star symbolizes the country’s openness to the five continents of the world.\\nThere are a few elements worth pointing out: although the majority of the Senegalese population is Muslim and relates the green to Islam, the Christian minority sees the green as hope, and the animists interpret the green in the flag as a symbol of fertility.\\nOn the other hand, it might not be a coincidence that the three colors of the flag are the same colors as the three main political parties in the country.\\nBetween 1959 and 1960, Senegal was part of a political federation with Mali and Sudan, sharing a common flag. It’s basically the same flag Senegal uses today but had an anthropomorphic symbol in the center, the Kanaga, instead of the star.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 20 August 1960 and used as it is until today.\\nFlag of Seychelles\\nFlag of Seychelles\\n5 colors: blue, yellow, red, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Seychelles: Blue represents sky and sea; yellow is for the sun giving light and life; red symbolizes the peoples’ determination to work for the future together in loving harmony; white represents justice and peace; green stands for the land and natural environment.

The five-point white star symbolizes liberty in Africa. Each of the five points stands for one of the historic realms occupied by the Somali people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Somalia\\nThe flag of Somalia is mainly blue with just one white five-point star in the center.\\nThe blue was initially used in the flag’s background as a tribute to the United Nations, that once administered the country, but currently, it’s interpreted as a symbol of the sky and the Gulf of Aden. The white star symbolizes the five places where Somalis live: Somalia, Djibouti, Somaliland, Ogaden (Ethiopia), and the provinces in the northeast of Kenya.\\nThe flag was designed by academic Mohammed Awale Liban, a nationalist who later had several political roles in the country, and was adopted on 12 October 1954.\\nFlag of South Africa\\nFlag of South Africa\\n6 colors: red, green, blue, black, white, gold.\\nMeaning of the flag of South africa: Y represents the united country after the Apartheid regime. Red symbolizes blood; blue symbolizes the sky; green symbolizes the rich vegetation; black symbolizes African people; white symbolizes white people; gold color symbolizes the mineral gold. Red, white and blue also symbolizes South African past colonizers, Great Britain and The Netherlands.\\nHistory of the Flag of South Africa\\nThe flag of South Africa is rather complex and includes a y-shaped geometrical figure laid horizontally, from left to right. That shape creates three distinct areas: black in the left, red at the top, and blue at the bottom. In addition to that, the y-shape has a yellow and a white border.\\nThis flag was adopted after the first elections held in the country after the end of apartheid. It was designed in March 1994 by South Africa’s official flag specialist, Frederick Brownell, and officially adopted on 27 April of that year. It replaced the old flag, in use since 1928, and that included symbols of the colonial past such as the Union Jack and the resemblance to the Dutch flag.\\nA public competition for the new flag was launched, but none of the over 7,000 applications were considered acceptable. Of all the applications, six were selected to be presented and discussed, but none sparked enthusiasm. After that, they hired design companies, but there was still no agreement. In the end, the task was handed over to the official flag specialist.\\nThe colors of the flag symbolize inclusiveness, representing all the groups that make up the country’s population. Yellow, black, and green are the colors of the National African Congress, the main political party in South Africa. Black represents the people, green represents fertility, and yellow represents the richness of the country’s subsoil. The red, white, and blue also represent the Dutch white minority, the Boers.\\nFlag of South Sudan\\nFlag of South Sudan\\n6 colors: black, red, green, blue, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of South Sudan: The colors are the Pan-Arab ones (white, red, green and black) and also blue and golden.

Red symbolises the battle for liberation and various other conflicts as well as the loss of lives of the brave fighters; white represents harmony, brightness and hope (white also symbolizes the White Flag League, a patriotic faction which rebelled against the settlers in 1924); black is the symbol of the country, since the word “Sudan” means black in Arabic language, and also stands for the black insignia of the fighters of independence who fought against the settlers during the Kimokino rebellion in the last years of the 19th century; green represents Islam, the growth of the territory and cultivation.\\nHistory of the Flag of Sudan\\nThe flag of Sudan has three horizontal stripes: red in the top, white in the middle, and black in the bottom.

White represents peace and optimism, as the nationalist group White Flag League, who rebelled against the colonial occupation in 1924. Black represents Sudan itself (in Arab, Sudan means black) and it’s also a tribute to the nationalists, who fought during the Mahdist Revolution at the end of the 19th century and who used a black flag. Green represents Islam, agriculture, and earth’s fertility.\\nThe first national flag of Sudan appeared on 1 January 1956 when the country became independent from the United Kingdom and Egypt. At the time, the flag had three horizontal stripes in blue, yellow, and green, which symbolized the Nile River, the desert sands, and the country’s vegetation respectively.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 20 May 1970.\\nFlag of Swaziland\\nFlag of Swaziland\\n5 colors: blue, yellow, red, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Swaziland (now called Eswatini): Blue represents peace and stability; red symbolizes past struggles; yellow stand for the mineral resources of the country.

The red stripe represents the blood that was shed for the nation, the blue stripes represent peace and stability, and the yellow stripes represent the country’s natural resources.\\nThe flag dates back to 1941 when King Sobhuza II created it and offered it to the Swazi Pioneer Corps.

The color black in the center symbolizes the people of Tanzania.\\nHistory of the Flag of Tanzania\\nThe flag of Tanzania is mostly covered by the diagonal black stripe across it, with yellow borders, thus creating two distinct areas: a top left side in green and a bottom right side in light blue.\\nThe flag of Tanzania is inspired by the flags of the regions of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, two regions that came together to create the country.\\nThe green represents farming and the abundant vegetation of the national territory, and the blue represents Zanzibar and the influence of the Indian Ocean. Black represents the people of Tanzania, and yellow represents the richness of the country’s subsoil.\\nThe flag was adopted when the country was created, on 30 June 1964.\\nFlag of Togo\\nFlag of Togo\\n4 colors: green, yellow, red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Togo: The red square represents the loyalty and the patriotism of Togo’s people; green stands for hope, fertility and agriculture; yellow represents mineral wealth and the belief that hard work and strength will bring prosperity.

The crescent and star are traditional symbols of Islam considered to bring good luck and also recall Tunisia’s history as part of the Ottoman Empire.\\nHistory of the Flag of Tunisia\\nThe flag of Tunisia is red with a white circle in the center. Inside that circle, there are a red Crescent Moon and a five-point star.\\nThe primary color, red, represents the blood shed by the Tunisian when the French conquered them in 1831, but others claim the red symbolizes the light of all the Islamic universe.\\nWhite represents peace, and the white circle represents the sun that lights the nation. The Crescent Moon represents the unity of Muslims, and the five-point star represents the five pillars of Islam. However, before that religion appeared, the symbol of the Crescent Moon was already present in Carthage where is now Tunisia. There is a possibility that the old reference made its way into the current flag, at least partially. Both the Crescent Moon and the sun were commonly used in Carthaginian artifacts with religious meaning, specifically linked to the cult of goddess Tanit.\\nThe historical roots of the flag of Tunisia go back to 1831 when it was first used by the navy of the kingdom of Tunis, with a strong influence from the flag of the Ottoman Empire. Something that was perfectly natural considering the existing historical ties.\\nAfter Tunisia became independent from France, in 1959, the old flag became the national flag, later revised in 1999.\\nFlag of Uganda\\nFlag of Uganda\\n3 colors: black, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Uganda: The colors of the flag of Uganda repeat from top to bottom.

In the center, inside a relatively small white circle, the national symbol of a grey-crowned crane. That bird is the symbol of Uganda and a part of the country’s coat of arms since it was run by the British. With a leg lifted, making it look like it’s about to take a step forward, it represents the country’s progress.\\nThe colors of the flag match with the ones of the main political party of Uganda, Uganda People’s Congress (UPC), that dominates the country’s political scene since 1962. But the colors are also common in African countries’ flags because of their all-encompassing meaning: the black symbolizes the people, the yellow symbolizes the sun and the union between Africans, and the red represents the blood that all people in the continent share.\\nThe flag was designed by Uganda’s Minister of Justice Grace Ibingira in 1962 and replaced a former flag, mostly green, that was used as a national flag in the months between independence and the first elections.\\nFlag of Zambia\\nFlag of Zambia\\n4 colors: green, red, black, orange.\\nMeaning of the flag of Zambia: Green symbolizes the fertile lands; red represents Zambia’s fight for freedom; black stand for the people of Zambia; orange is for the rich minerals and natural resources of the country.

Green symbolizes the fertility of the fields and agriculture; yellow represents minerals, the rich natural resources of the country; red stands for the bloodshed during the war for independence; black symbolizes the native people of Zimbabwe and their legacy. The white on the triangle is for peace; the red star represents the rising hopes of the nation. The soapstone bird is a national symbol of Zimbabwe.\\nHistory of the Flag of Zimbabwe\\nZimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, has a flag with seven horizontal stripes with the following sequence of colors resembling a mirror: green, yellow, red, black, red, yellow, green (from top to bottom). The stripes are the same width.\\nThere’s a white triangle on the left, with its base covering all the flag’s left side and the vertex pointing towards the center. In the middle of the triangle, there’s a symbol that includes a red five-point star and a yellow bird.\\nIn addition to the obvious influence of the Pan-African movement, the choice of colors was also inspired by the ones used by the Zimbabwean African National Union – Patriotic Front political party, the leading builders of the current regime.\\nBlack represents the African people, red represents the blood shed during the fight for independence, yellow represents the country’s mineral richness, and green represents its landscape. The white is associated with peace.\\nThe red star officially represents the country’s aspirations to a better future but was most likely inspired by socialism and the revolutionary fight that allowed the current regime to rule.

It was formally adopted on 18 April 1980.\\nStates not recognized, partially recognized or disputed\\nFlag of Somaliland\\n4 colors: green, white, red, black\\nMeaning of the flag of Somaliland: The flag uses Pan-Arab colors.

Asian flags vary on color and meaning. On this page, I list all flags of Asia and their colors.\\nCopyright: I own the copyright usage of these images. You cannot use text or image without permission.\\nAsia National Flags\\nAlphabetic order\\nFlags of Asia\\nFlag of Afghanistan\\nFlag of Afghanistan\\n3 colors: black, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Afghanistan: The colors of the flag of Afghanistan include the pan-Arab colors of black, green, red (and white), which represent the historical dynasties that once ruled the region. Although not everybody agrees, it is thought that black represents previous Afghan flags which symbolized the sovereign; red is as a sign of progress, copied from the Soviet flag; green represents Islam. The white coat of arms in the center is a mosque with its mihrab facing toward Mecca. The mosque is surrounded by two sheaves of wheat. Above the coat of arms, the sacred line is written, “There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is His prophet, and Allah is great.” Below the insignia is written “Afghanistan 1298”.\\nHistory of the Flag of Afghanistan\\nThe flag of Afghanistan has three vertical stripes: black, red, and green from left to right. In the center, the national symbol overlaps the red stripe. It’s a complex composition that includes a mihrab (a Mosque niche that marks the direction of Mecca) and a minbar (a pulpit). In Arab, the inscription “God is Great.”\\nThe black represents the old Abbasid Caliphate, the red symbolizes the dignity of the royal family, and the green is the traditional color of Islam. It’s a flag inspired by the old imperial flag, with a religious meaning that’s reinforced by the emblem in the center.\\nThe current flag was officially adopted in 2013 but has the same basic design of several flags used over the years, with several changes.\\nA black flag used since the middle of the 18th century, to which different elements were added, had the same symbol we see in the flag today in 1928. That was the year King Amanullah visited Europe, and that may have influenced his decision to change the flag and adopt the three-colored design that lasted until the present time. Between 1928 and now, there were only three times when the Afghan flag didn’t have this three-colored design. The longest period when it happened was during the Taliban regime that ended in 2002.\\nFlag of Armenia\\nFlag of Armenia\\n3 colors: red, blue, orange.\\nMeaning of the flag of Armenia: The colors on the Armenia Flag represent its people. Red stands for the sacrifice and blood of the Armenian soldiers shed in past and present wars; orange symbolizes the fertile lands of the country; blue represents hope and aspiration for the progress of Armenia.\\nHistory of the Flag of Armenia\\nThe flag of Armenia has three horizontal stripes: red at the top, blue in the middle, and mustard yellow at the bottom.\\nThis flag appeared during the First Republic of Armenia (1918-1922), between the end of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, a political union that included Georgia and Azerbaijan, and the time when they became part of the Soviet Union.  \\nThe symbolism of the colors is officially defined in the Constitution. The red represents the mountains of the country, the Armenians, their permanent fight for survival to maintain Christian faith, and the country’s independence and freedom. The blue symbolizes the Armenians wish to live under a blue sky, which means peace and stability. The yellow symbolizes the Armenians’ creativity, talent, and ability to work hard.\\nOther interpretations connect the red to the Armenian Genocide, the blue to the sky, and the yellow to the courage of the Armenian people.\\nThe current flag was officially adopted on 24 August 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Armenia’s independence. The flag is similar to the one used during the First Republic of Armenia but with different proportions.\\nFlag of Azerbaijan\\nFlag of Azerbaijan\\n3 colors: blue, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Azerbaijan: Blue symbolizes the Turks; red represents progress; green is for Islam. The white semi-circular moon, or crescent, is also for Islam; the eight points of the star stands for the eight branches of the Turkic people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Azerbaijan\\nThe flag of Azerbaijan has three horizontal stripes: light blue at the top, red in the middle, and green at the bottom. There are a white Crescent Moon and an eight-point star in the middle, overlapping the red stripe.\\nThe blue symbolizes the country’s Turkish cultural heritage, red symbolizes progress, and green is the traditional color of Islam.\\nAs for the Crescent Moon and the star, it could be easily associated with Islam, but the star raises some questions. Some authors believe it’s a coincidence that the number of points in the star is the same as the number of letters in Azerbaijan (in Arab), and the same as the number of Turkish tribes who live in the country.\\nAs it happened with Armenia, the current flag of Azerbaijan was used for the first time between 1918 and 1920, after the end of First World War and before joining the Soviet Union.\\nThe flag was created by the first and only president of Armenia during that period, Mammed Amin Rasulzade, and the original flag made by him and his wife is displayed at the Museum of History of Azerbaijan. According to Mammed Amin Rasulzade, the flag represented a connection to the Turkish heritage, modernity, and the Islamic culture.\\nUzeyir Hajibeyov, the composer of the national anthem, included references to the flag, linking the blue to multinationalism, red to progress and culture, and green to Islam.\\nFor historian Nasib Nasibli, it was Ali bey Huseynzade, one of the ideological mentors of the Azeri nationalist movement, who designed the color combination in the flag.\\nSmaller changes were made to the flag when it was officially adopted on 5 February 1991, after the Soviet Union collapse and the country’s independence.\\nFlag of Bahrain\\nFlag of Bahrain\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bahrain: Red represents the Kharijite sect of Islam; white indicates the truces Bahrain had made with neighbouring countries in the 19th century. The serrated triangles exist to distinguish the Bahranian flag from the ones of its neighboring countries and represent the five pillars of Islam.\\nHistory of the Flag of Bahrain\\nThis flag has two colorful areas: white on the left and red on the right. A zig-zag line separates the two areas, a different effect in world flags. Only Qatar, another country in the Persian Gulf area, has a similar flag.\\nThat visual composition creates five triangles. There used to be more triangles, but the final number was decided in 2002, to symbolize the five pillars of Islam.\\nThe first concept for the current flag appeared in 1932. Before that, the first flags of Bahrain, that appeared at the end of the 18th century, had been entirely red, with a white narrow vertical stripe on the left side introduced in 1820. That change was forced by the naval pact with the United Kingdom, which established that the flags on the ships of all countries involved would have a white stripe.\\nThe current flag was officially adopted on 14 February 2002.\\nFlag of Bangladesh\\nFlag of Bangladesh\\n2 colors: green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bangladesh: Green stand for the greenery of Bangladesh, its vivacity and youthfulness, as well as it is the traditional color of Islam; the red disc stands for the rising sun and the blood spilt by the the people in Bangladesh to achieve their independence.\\nHistory of the Flag of Bangladesh\\nThe flag of Bangladesh is entirely green with a red circle in the center. Actually, the circle is slightly off to the left, so it appears to be in the center when the flag flaps in the wind.\\nThe symbolism is straightforward. The red circle represents the sun rising over the region of Bengal, that includes a part of India and Bangladesh, but also the blood shed during the fight for the country’s independence. The green background symbolizes the landscapes of Bangladesh, but it’s also connected to Islam.\\nThe flag has a curious history. It was designed by a group of students and activists that belonged to the Swadheen Bangla Nucleus, on 6 June 1970. They gathered in a room of a university residency in Dhaka, and made the flag with the clothes donated by Bazlur Rahman Lasker, who was the owner of Apollo Tailors in the new market in the city.\\nThat first flag, used during the Bangladesh Liberation War, used to have the outline of the country inside the circle, and it was hoisted for the first time at Dhaka University on 2 March 1971.\\nAfter Bangladesh became independent, the current version of the flag was officially adopted on 17 January 1972.\\nFlag of Bhutan\\nFlag of Bhutan\\n3 colors: red, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bhutan: Yellow represents the secular authority of the King; white stands for purity and loyalty; red represents the Drukpas monasteries and Buddhist religion. The dragon is holding jewels in its claws, which signify the nation’s wealth; the snarling mouth of the dragon symbolizes the strength of the people protecting the country.\\nHistory of the Flag of Bhutan\\nThe flag of Bhutan has two triangular areas: the top left is yellow, and the bottom right is orange. In the center, covering most of the flag, there is a white dragon with black lines.\\nThe dragon symbolizes the name of the country, Druk Yul, which means something like “the country of the dragon that spits fire.” That name is associated with the Druk monastery, founded in the 13th century.\\nThe yellow symbolizes secular life, and the orange symbolizes the importance of Buddhism in Bhutan. Both colors together in equal proportions symbolize the sacred bond between royalty and the people of Bhutan. The white represents purity. Those flag symbols are officially defined in the Constitution.\\nAlthough a flag inspired by the same symbols existed since the 19th century, the modern version was designed in 1947 by Mayeum Choying Wangmo Dorji, the mother of queen Kesang Choden.\\nThe flag had a series of changes made in the late 1950s by Jigme Dorji Wangchuck on king’s request. Officially, the current flag was adopted in 1969, although the differences are practically indistinguishable.\\nFlag of Brunei\\nFlag of Brunei\\n3 colors: yellow, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Brunei: Yellow is the color of royalty and represents the sultanate; white and black bands symbolize Brunei’s chief ministers. The coat of arms is a crescent (symbol of Islam) connected with a parasol (symbol of monarchy), with two gloves on both sides. The inscriptions in the crescent and the ribbon have Arabic inscriptions which translate to “State of Brunei, Abode of peace” and “There is no deity but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God”.\\nHistory of the Flag of Brunei\\nThe background of the flag of Brunei is yellow, which has been the color of the Sultan of Brunei since the Middle Ages (elsewhere in Southeast Asia, yellow is typically associated with royalty), with two diagonal stripes from the top left to the bottom right, one top white and one bottom black.\\nIn the center, the national symbol in red with the inscription in yellow “Always render service with God’s guidance.” The symbol includes a Crescent Moon laid out horizontally, with the tips pointing up towards the sky, protected by an umbrella. On both sides, there are two hands with palms facing up. The umbrella symbolizes Monarchy, and the hands symbolize Government’s benevolence.\\nThe white and black stripes symbolize the two ministers of the Sultan. Earlier, these two state figures used to be the mentors of the young kings and later their advisors. The black stripe that represents the Prime Minister is slightly wider.\\nThis flag has a long History, and it evolved over the years with new elements being added. The completely yellow flag of the Empire of Brunei appeared in the mid-14th century. When it later became a British Protectorate, between 1906 and 1959, they used the same flag but without the emblem in the center.\\nBrunei adopted the current flag in 1959, after independence.\\nFlag of Cambodia\\nFlag of Cambodia\\n2 colors: blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Cambodia: Blue represents the nation’s royalty; red stands for the nation; white symbolizes religion. The emblem of the Angkor Vat Hindu temple represents the structure of the universe.\\nHistory of the Flag of Cambodia\\nThe flag of Cambodia has three horizontal flags: one wider red in the middle and two dark blue (top and bottom). In the center of the flag, overlapping the red stripe, there’s a depiction of the famous Angkor Wat, the main temple of the amazing city that once existed near what’s now known as Siem Reap.\\nThe red stripe symbolizes the bravery of the Khmer people and is associated with the nation as a whole. The blue symbolizes freedom, cooperation, and fraternity, and is also associated with the flag of the royal house. The temple symbolizes justice, cultural heritage, and integrity, but it’s also connected to the importance of religion.\\nThe flag was initially adopted in 1948, after the independence of Cambodia from France, but the Cambodian flag had the same colors and an image of the temple in the center since 1863. When the Khmer Rouge (Red Khmer) rose to power, a violent regime that controlled the country from 1976 to 1979, the flag was changed into an entirely red flag with the symbol of the temple in yellow. Under the Vietnamese ruling that followed, the flag was practically unchanged and after two more versions, the old national flag returned, officially adopted in 1993.\\nFlag of China\\nFlag of China\\n2 colors: red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of China: Red is a traditional color in Chinese culture and also represents the communist revolution; the stars are yellow to represent the official color of the Manchu dynasty and to imply that China belongs to the Chinese people, a “yellow race”. The big star symbolizes the Communist Party; the four smaller stars represent the four social classes of the traditional Chinese society united under the Communist Party of China (working class, peasantry, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie or capitalists). The other potential meaning of the stars is to represent the five main ethnicities of China: the Han, Manchus, Mongols, Hui and Tibetans. The stars all have 5 points to reflect the importance of this number in Chinese philosophy, being associated with the five elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, Metal) and therefore historically associated with the Emperor of China.\\nHistory of the Flag of China\\nThe flag of the People’s Republic of China is red with a set of yellow five-point stars: a larger one with four smaller ones laid in a semi-circle on the right.\\nRed represents the Communist Revolution that followed the Second World War.\\nAccording to the official interpretation of the Communist Party, that rules the country, the stars symbolize the union of the Chinese people. In detail, Mao Tse Tung explained that the bigger star represents the Communist Party of China around which the social classes gather: farmers, factory workers, petite bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie. The layout of the stars is similar to the map of China.\\nOthers claim the five stars also represent the five ethnic groups in the country: Han, Zhuang, Hui, Manchus, and Uyghurs.\\nThe flag was officially adopted on 27 September 1949, putting aside many other competing designs. In one of them, very similar to this one, there was a sickle and hammer in the middle of the larger star. In another version, initially the favorite of Mao Tse Tung, the four smaller stars didn’t exist and there was a yellow stripe at the bottom of the flag, from left to right, that represented the Yellow River. But these are just a couple of examples among the several other proposals.\\nFlag of Cyprus\\nFlag of Cyprus\\n3 colors: white, orange, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Cyprus: The white field of the background has a copper-orange island in the center, representing the abundance of copper ore in the country. Under the island there are two olive branches which symbolize the peace and harmony which the country has been trying to negotiate between the Greek and the Turkish communities. That is why the Constitution of Cyprus forbids the use of a cross or crescent and blue (Greek) and red (Turkish) colors in the Cypriot flag.\\nHistory of the Flag of Cyprus\\nThe flag of Cyprus is mainly white with the country’s outline in the center in dark yellow. Underneath the shape, two branches cross.\\nThe color chosen to represent the island’s map on the flag, symbolizes copper, Cyprus’ main natural resource. The name Cyprus is also based on the Greek word for copper.\\nThe crossed branches symbolize peace, an always central topic in an island marked by conflicts between the Greeks and the Turkish, that ended with Turkey invading the island in 1974 and creating an independent area on the west side of the island.\\nAn elementary school teacher designed the flag and it was approved by Cyprus’ first president Makarios III, according to criteria included in the Constitution that didn’t allow to use the same colors of the flags of Greece and Turkey, red and blue. There was an attempt to replace the flag in 2004, but a national referendum showed the population’s wish to keep the same design. That new flag was meant to have three horizontal stripes, blue, yellow, and red from top to bottom, separated by white lines.\\nThe current flag was officially approved after the independence of Cyprus from the United Kingdom on 16 August 1960, with slight adjustments made later and approved one final time on 24 April 2006.\\nFlag of East Timor\\nFlag of East Timor\\n4 colors: red, yellow, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of East Timor: Yellow represents the traces of colonialism in the History of East Timor; black symbolizes the dissimulation that needs to be conquered; the red background represents the struggle for national freedom of Timor Leste. The five pointed white star represents peace.\\nHistory of the Flag of East Timor\\nThe flag of East Timor is red with two overlapping triangles, with their base on the left and the vertexes pointing towards the center. The bottom triangle, smaller and more visible, is yellow and the top one is black. Laid over this triangle, there’s a white five-point star.\\nThe flag’s background color symbolizes the blood shed during the fight for independence, while black is a reference to the colonial past. Yellow symbolizes hope in a better future, and the white star represents peace and freedom.\\nThat flag, inspired by the main political party FRETILIN, was officially adopted in 1974 when East Timor gained independence from Portugal but the immediate invasion by Indonesia that followed didn’t allow them to use that flag.\\nIt wasn’t until 19 May 2002 and the second independence, this time from their powerful neighbors, that East Timor could adopt the flag. It’s, therefore, one of the most recent flags in the world.\\nFlag of Georgia\\nFlag of Georgia\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Georgia: The flag of Georgia features a white background with a large red St. George’s Cross centered over it representing the Georgian kingdom in the 5th century. In each of the four white rectangles created by the cross there are 4 more red Blonisi crosses. All the crosses probably represent the five Holy Wounds that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion.\\nHistory of the Flag of Georgia\\nThe flag of Georgia is very distinguishable with a white background and a red St. George’s cross, like the one used in the English flag, splitting the flag into four sections. On each of the four sections, there are smaller crosses, also red.\\nThe origin of this flag is a political one: it used to be the flag of the National Movement, led by President Saakashvili, who became the leader of the country after the Revolution of Roses in 2002. However, the flag goes back at least to the 14th century, when a Franciscan monk described it as the flag of the kingdom of Georgia.\\nThis is the last flag of several different flags used by Georgia in the last 120 years. In the 20th century alone, Georgia had seven flags including the ones imposed by the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the USSR and independence, Georgia began to use a mainly dark red flag, but it was never a popular option because it was always associated to the chaos and turmoil that followed independence.\\nThe current flag was adopted officially on 24 January 2004, and it’s one of the most recent flags in the world.\\nFlag of India\\nFlag of India\\n3 colors: orange, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of India: The three colors in the flag of India symbolize ideals cultivated by the constitution of India. Orange (or Saffron),stands for courage, sacrifice, valor and the spirit of renunciation; white is for truth, peace and purity of thought; green represents culture, fertility and faith. The “Ashoka Chakra “, the blue spinning wheel with twenty-four spokes, symbolizes the eternal wheel of progress and righteousness.\\nHistory of the Flag of India\\nIndia has a three-colored flag with horizontal stripes. From top to bottom: saffron, white, and green. In the center, laid over the white stripe, there’s an ancient symbol representing the sun in dark blue that’s historically connected with Brahmanism and god Vishnu. This symbol, which was mentioned for the first time in the 3rd century BC, replaced another one that depicted the wheel of a loom and that had been included by Gandhi in the first flag of modern India. That flag was proposed by Gandhi at the Indian National Congress in 1921 and was designed by Pingali Venkayya.\\nThe flag was in the center of tensions between British controlled India and the ones fighting for independence. In fact, the flag presented by Gandhi played a key role in establishing a national identity, and the so-called “flag movement” gained momentum by being supported by even politically rival communities like the Muslim community.\\nThe symbolism of the flag of India was defined in 1947 by philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who became president:\\n” Bhagwa or the Saffron denotes renunciation or disinterestedness. Our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work. The white in the center is light, the path of truth to guide our conduct. The green shows our relation to (the) soil, our relation to the plant life here, on which all other life depends. The “Ashoka Chakra” in the center of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma. Truth or Satya, dharma or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag. Again, the wheel denotes motion. There is death in stagnation. There is life in movement. India should no more resist change, it must move and go forward. The wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change. “\\nThe current flag was adopted when India became independent on 22 July 1947, after Nehru presented it to the Constituent Assembly. It was approved unanimously.\\nFlag of Indonesia\\nFlag of Indonesia\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Indonesia: Red stands for courage; white is for purity. Red can also stand for physical life, while white symbolizes spiritual life. These two colors combined make up humans. The flag of Indonesia has been named “Sang Saka Merah-Putih”, meaning the “Sacred Red and White”.\\nHistory of the Flag of Indonesia\\nCOMING SOON…\\nFlag of Iran\\nFlag of Iran\\n3 colors: green, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Iran: The colors in the Iranian flag date back to the times when the Shahs dominated the country. Green symbolizes Islam and also stands for hope and aspirations for a better future; white is a traditional symbol of peace; red represents the courage that the Iranians treasure. The emblem is made up of four crescents with a sword in the center. The sword in the center represents the strength of the nation. To the bottom of the green band and top of the red band the takbir is written twenty-two times in the Kufic script. The takbir reads the phrase Allahu Akbar which translates into “God is greater than can be described.” The number twenty-two is significant as it refers to the Islamic Revolution that occurred on the twenty-second day of the eleventh month of the Iranian calendar.\\nHistory of the Flag of Iran\\nThe flag of Iran has three horizontal stripes: green at the top, white in the middle, and red at the bottom. In the center, laid over the white stripe, there’s a symbol that represents a tulip in five parts, that correspond to the five pillars of Islam.\\nThere are two lines separating the red and the green stripe from the white one, which have the inscription “God is Great” (known as takbir) repeated 11 times and written in Kufic characters, a classical way to write in Arabic.\\nIn addition to being the color of Islam, green has a specific symbolism in the Iranian culture representing development, happiness, union, nature, vitality, and the languages spoken in the country.\\nThe white represents freedom. It’s a color that can include all colors and that infinity of possibilities is what makes white the color of freedom.\\nThe red, in addition to symbolizing martyrdom, also symbolizes bravery, fire, and sophistication in Iran.\\nThe evolution and history of the flag of Iran are as long as the country’s history and, over the centuries, the country has shown different flags and different colors.\\nBetween the 18th and 19th centuries, the flags had a triangular shape and only adopted the rectangular design in the Qajar Dynasty (1789-1925). This was also the time when the first flag of Iran with the colors we know today appeared for the first time. It was designed by Amir Kabir, the chancellor of Persia from 1848 to 1851. That flag had a very wide white stripe in the center, and the colorful stripes were as thin as lines. In the center, there was a yellow lion, an old symbol associated with Persia and Islam.\\nIn 1886, the lion was still there, but the stripes’ proportions were closer to the current version. In 1906, after the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, the country adopted a flag that was almost the same as the current one. After 1907, the lion was kept only in the State flag, while the national flag was simplified to a three-color design that remained the same until the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\\nIn 1980, the new regime changed the flag and introduced the symbol designed by Hamid Nadimi. The current flag was adopted on 29 July that same year.\\nFlag of Iraq\\nFlag of Iraq\\n3 colors: red, white, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Iraq: Red represents the bloody struggle and the courage to overcome it; white signifies the bright future for Iraq and the generosity of Iraqis; black symbolizes oppression against Islam and the triumph of Islam. The green of the Takbir (which reads “Allahu Akbar”, “God is greater than can be described”) represents Islam as it is believed to be a favorite color of Prophet Muhammad and his daughter, Fatima. Green is also mentioned several times in the Quran, in relation to paradise.\\nHistory of the Flag of Iraq\\nThe flag of Iraq has the colors of the Pan-Arab movement in a basic three-color design with three horizontal stripes: red at the top, white in the middle, and black at the bottom. In the center, in Arabic, the inscription “God is Great” in green, written in Kufic, an old writing style.\\nThe symbolism of those colors is the same in many Arab countries. Red means bravery, white means generosity, and black means victory. Green is the traditional color of Islam.\\nThe Iraqi flag first appeared in 1921, when the first flag of the Kingdom of Iraq appeared, influenced by the Arab Liberation (1916-1918) when the Ottomans were ousted from Middle Eastern areas where Arabs lived. That first flag resembled the one used by Jordan today and was used until 1958.\\nThat year, and after the political union with Syria and Egypt, Iraq joined Jordan and adopted a common flag. However, things changed six months later with the Iraqi Revolution that abolished the monarchy regime in the country. After four years using a different flag, despite being based in the same color scheme, Iraq adopted a flag in 1963 that would be in use until 1991. It was very similar to the current one but with five green five-point stars in the center.\\nBetween 1991 and 2004 the inscription “God is Great” was used in the flag, in the handwriting of the country’s leader Saddam Hussein. The end of his regime meant a change and the inscription remained but now written in Kufic script.\\nIn 2008, the flag took its current design, removing the three green stars, and was officially adopted on 22 January that same year.\\nFlag of Israel\\nFlag of Israel\\n2 colors: white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Israel: The basic design of the flag of Israel remembers the Tallit, the Jewish prayer shawl in white with blue colored stripes. On the white part of the flag there is a blue Star of David, composed by two crossing equal blue triangles, from the Biblical times a common symbol of the People of Israel. The Star of David is also known as the Jewish star and is a symbol of Judaism. A more modern interpretation of the Israeli flag identifies the blue and white stripes representing purity, guided by the principles of the Torah, and the Star of David representing a new beginning for Israel.\\nHistory of the Flag of Israel\\nThe flag of Israel has only two colors: blue and white. There are two narrow stripes at the top and the bottom, and a much wider white stripe in the center. Laid over that central stripe is a six-point Star of David in blue.\\nThe choice of colors symbolizes Zionism’s expression of purity and the sky. The blue, in general, symbolizes the divine glory and the strictness of God, while white represents God’s generosity.\\nThe blue stripes are a representation of the tallit, a shawl that’s used by Jewish when praying. The star, a symbol of Judaism for over 700 years, was in the ring of King Solomon and is also known as the Seal of Solomon.\\nThe flag of Israel goes back to the end of the 19th century when the Zionist movement tried to create a Jewish State in Palestine. In 1897, at the time of the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, Morris Harris, a member of the New York Hovevei Zion, designed the flag that was later manufactured by his mother, Lena Harris.\\nThe next year, at the Second Zionist Congress, it was decided to accept that flag as the official flag of Zionism. When the State of Israel was founded in 1948, they adopted the current flag, on 28 October of that year.\\nFlag of Japan\\nFlag of Japan\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Japan: The Japanese flag symbolizes Japan’s location in the east of Asia, where the sun rises. Japan is called “Land of the Rising Sun”. So, the sun goddess ‘Amaterasu’, founder of Japan and ancestor of its emperors, is represented by the red disc in the center. It symbolizes the bright future for Japan, while white represents honesty, integrity and purity of the Japanese people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Japan\\nThe flag of Japan is white with a red circle in the center. Japan is known as the country of the rising sun, and that’s precisely what the red circle represents. The symbol that has been associated with Japan for centuries is called Hinomaru by the Japanese. The cult of the sun has always been very important in Japan, and it was believed that the Japanese emperors were the descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu.\\nThe symbol that’s now part of the current flag was already used by samurais in the 12th century and was used as a military symbol for centuries. When in 1870 Japan began to open up to the rest of the world, leaving behind their isolationism politics they’d been following for a long time, they immediately adopted the current flag.\\nFlag of Jordan\\nFlag of Jordan\\n4 colors: black, white, green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Jordan: The colors of the stripes in the flag of Jordan represent the historical dynasties of the region. Black symbolizes the Arab Abbasid dynasty; white stands for the Umayyad dynasty; green is for the Fatimid dynasty; red stands for the Hashemite Emirate, the precursor to the current Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Each of the points of the star symbolizes one of the pillars of Islam, the seven verses of the first surah of the Qur’an, called the Fatihah.\\nHistory of the Flag of Jordan\\nThe flag of Jordan has three horizontal stripes: black at the top, white in the middle, and green at the bottom. On the left side, there’s a red triangle laid vertically with the base covering all of the flag’s left side and the vertex pointing towards the middle. Laid over that triangle, there’s a seven-point white star.\\nThe set of colors is associated with the Pan-Arab movement and the flag used in the Arab Revolution (1916-1918) against the ruling of Middle Eastern areas inhabited by Arabs by the Ottoman Empire.\\nThe colors of the stripes represent three important caliphates: black is for the Abbasid, white is for the Ummayad, and green is for the Fatimid. The red represents the Hashemite dynasty that rules Jordan.\\nThe star was added when the flag was officially adopted on 18 April 1928, and it represents the union between all Arab people. The seven points represent the seven hills on which Amman, the country’s capital, was built but also symbolizes the faith in one single god, humanity, humbleness, national spirit, virtue, social justice, and aspiration.\\nFlag of Kazakhstan\\nFlag of Kazakhstan\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kazakhstan: The solid blue background means peace and unity of people living in Kazakhstan, as well as the infinite, pure sky. The sun represents the source of life and energy but is also a symbol of progress and movement for nomads. The silhouette of the sun is a symbol of well-being and abundance. 32 beams come out of the sun, shaped like a grain to symbolize abundance and prosperity. The eagle represents the power of the state and astuteness. Also, for people living in the steppe, this bird of prey symbolizes independence, freedom, aspiration and, at the same time, strength to overcome any obstacles and difficulties. The ornament on the left identifies the culture and traditions of Kazakhstan.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kazakhstan\\nThe flag of Kazakhstan is mainly light blue with a yellow symbol in the center: a steppe eagle, known locally as berkut, flying under a sun with 32 beams.\\nOn the left side, there’s a national pattern of Kazakhstan in yellow across the flag from top to bottom.\\nThe shade of blue used in the flag is common among the nomadic people of Central Asia and has been always present in the flags of Kazakhstan. In the flag, it represents peace, freedom, ethnic and cultural union of all the people living in the country, that form a more significant, more complicated cluster of six different groups. The sun symbolizes energy and life, abundance and wealth. The eagle symbolizes the State, as a pillar of national independence, freedom, and an enabler of great flights towards the future.\\nAlthough it’s a recent national flag, it’s inspired by ancient traditional symbols. It’s likely that the flag of the Kazakh Khanate wasn’t much different and had the same shade of blue. Even when the country was part of the Soviet Union the flag had a stripe with that same color, and over the centuries the flags of different tribes in the area featured a golden eagle.\\nThe current flag was officially adopted on 4 June 1992, about two years after the country’s post-Soviet Union independence.\\nFlag of Kuwait\\nFlag of Kuwait\\n4 colors: green, white, red, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kuwait: The colors of the flag of Kuwait make up the pan-Arab colors, a combination used in the Arab world which represents the various dynasties that once ruled the region. Red symbolizes the Hashemites; green is for the Fatimid dynasty; white represents the Ummayad dynasty; and black symbolizes the Abbasid dynasty (or possibly the prophet Mohammed). On the flag of Kuwait, green represents the fertile lands and meadows of the region; white is for purity and deeds; red is for the blood and the heroism of the soldiers who have fought for Kuwait; black represents the defeat of enemies.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kuwait\\nThe flag of Kuwait uses the same color scheme as the Pan-Arab movement, born from the flags used during the Arab Revolution in 1916.\\nIt has three horizontal stripes: green at the top, white in the middle, and red at the bottom. On the left side, there’s a black trapezium with its base covering the flag from top to bottom.\\nIn addition to the historical symbolism of the colors, in the country’s history white symbolizes the actions, black symbolizes the fights, green symbolizes the fields of Kuwait, and red symbolizes the swords used to defend the nation. Another interpretation, based in the popular Arab poem, claims green is fertility, white is peace, red is noble actions, and black is the battlefield.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 7 September 1961, and it’s completely different from previous Kuwait flags that had been mainly red since the 18th century, which happened with most of the countries at the Persian Gulf.\\nFlag of Kyrgyzstan\\nFlag of Kyrgyzstan\\n2 colors: red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kyrgyzstan: The red background symbolizes the bravery and valor of the people; the yellow sun is for peace and wealth. Coming from the sun, there are 40 rays representing the 40 Kyrgyz tribes. The two sets of three lines crossing the sun are a stylized representation of a “tunduk”, the crown of a traditional Kyrgyz roof.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kyrgyzstan\\nThe flag of Kyrgyzstan is mostly red with a yellow sun laid over.\\nThe predominance of red is probably connected to Manas, an epic hero who is said to have gathered all the tribes in Kyrgyzstan under one common nation. According to the legend, the flag of this national hero was the same color. However, red also symbolizes bravery and value.\\nAs for the sun, it has 40 small sunbeams that represent the 40 tribes of Kyrgyzstan and also the 40 followers of Manas. The sun also represents prosperity and peace. The symbol also contains an abstract representation of the roof of a yurt seen from the inside, the traditional house of the Central Asian people. Its presence on the flag symbolizes the origins of life, the union between time and space, and the importance of a comfortable home.\\nOver the last few years, there’s been some debate about the possibility of changing the flag, ironically because different interpretations of its symbols have caused some tensions in the country.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 3 March 1992, about one year after the declaration of independence that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.\\nFlag of Laos\\nFlag of Laos\\n2 colors: red, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Laos: Red stands for the bloodshed and sacrifice in the freedom struggle; blue symbolizes the resources of the country. The white moon is the moon over the Mekong river.\\nHistory of the Flag of Laos\\nThe flag of Laos has a white circle in the center and three horizontal stripes: a more wide, dark blue stripe in the middle, and two narrow red stripes at the top and the bottom.\\nThe circle represents the national union and the full moon shining over the Mekong River, represented by the wide blue stripe. The red stripes symbolize the blood shed during the fight for freedom.\\nThis flag was adopted for the first time after the Second World War on 12 October 1945, but soon after Laos reinstated the centuries-old symbols, inherited from the Kingdom of Luang Prabang, with a red flag and three elephants.\\nIn 1975, after the Vietnam War was over and political forces supported by communist powers controlled the region, Laos was ruled by the Pathet Lao political party.\\nThat political party had adopted the flag of the short-lived government of Lao Issara (1945-1946) and adopted it as Laos’ official national flag on 2 December 1975.\\nThe flag of Laos has one particularity: it’s one of the two communist countries’ flags without a symbol that represents that political ideology. The other one is the flag of Cuba.\\nFlag of Lebanon\\nFlag of Lebanon\\n3 colors: red, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Lebanon: Red represents the blood spilt in the freedom struggle; white symbolizes peace. The cedar tree is the symbol of steadiness and immortality.\\nHistory of the Flag of Lebanon\\nThe flag of Lebanon has three horizontal stripes: two red ones at the top and bottom, and one wide white in the middle with the symbol of a cedar tree, Lebanon’s national tree, in green.\\nThe symbolism of the cedar goes back to the biblical ages and represents holiness, eternity, and peace.\\nThe white is a symbol of snow, that you can see in the country’s highest peaks, but also peace and purity. The red symbolizes the blood shed while defending Lebanon from continuous invasions.\\nThe flag was an improvised design by members of the parliament during the declaration of independence on 7 December 1943.\\nFlag of Malaysia\\nFlag of Malaysia\\n4 colors: red, white, blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Malaysia: Blue stands for the unity of the Malaysian people and was originally adopted from the British Union Jack, representing Malaysia’s link to Britain; yellow represents the royal color of the Malay rulers and also the unity of the federal government and a group of thirteen states, represented by the fourteen red bands. The crescent and star imagery represent Islam. The name of the Malaysian flag is “Jalur Gemilang”, meaning “stripes of glory”.\\nHistory of the Flag of Malaysia\\nThe flag of Malaysia has a series of horizontal stripes, resembling the design of the flag of the United States of America. It has a total of 14 stripes representing the 13 members of the Malay federation plus the territory of Kuala Lumpur, the capital.\\nOn the top left corner, there’s a dark blue square with a yellow Crescent Moon and a 14-point star.\\nThe colors of the flag are a reference to the Commonwealth, the community of English-speaking countries of which Malaysia is part of, except the yellow, which is a color traditionally related to the regions’ royal power.\\nThe star and the Crescent Moon are symbols of Islam, the country’s main religion, but the star also symbolizes the union between the States that are part of the federation.\\nThe flag was designed in 1947 by a young architect, Mohamed Hamzah, who worked for the government at the time. He entered a national competition with two designs he created under two weeks, and the people picked one of his ideas, among 373 applications.\\nThat was inspired by the flag of the British East India Company, except the star of that first flag had 11 points, and the number of stripes increased in 1963 to reflect the updated number of the federation states.\\nThe flag was officially adopted on 26 May 1950 and changed into the current design on 16 September 1963.\\nFlag of Maldives\\nFlag of Maldives\\n2 colors: red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Maldives: Red symbolizes heroes who have sacrificed their lives in defense of the country’s independence and sovereignty; green represents peace, prosperity and the wealth of palm trees; the white crescent symbolizes the Islamic faith of the island nation.\\nHistory of the Flag of Maldives\\nThe flag of Maldives has a red background with a green square covering all the central area. There’s a white Crescent Moon in the middle of that square.\\nThe red symbolizes the most common: the blood that was shed during the fight for independence. The green has a religious meaning because it’s the color of Islam, the country’s main religion, but it’s also associated with progress and peace. The Crescent Moon reaffirms Islam’s importance in the Maldives.\\nThe flag of the archipelago has always been traditionally red. Up until 1903, the flag was completely red, but it changed a bit since then. That year, they added a thin vertical stripe on the left side with diagonal black and white lines. In 1926, they added the Crescent Moon. In 1953, they added the green square. And in 1965, when the Maldives gained independence from the United Kingdom, the flag took its current shape, removing the side stripe.

The soyombo symbol is a character in the Mongolian script and is also found on the coat of arms of Mongolia. It is composed by many symbols. At the top there is a flame, representing growth and wealth. Each tongue of the flame stands for time (past, present and future). Under the flame there is a sun over a crescent moon, representing Mongolia’s eternal existence. The two triangles pointing down next to rectangular bands represent spears defeating enemies. In the middle of the soyombo is the yin-yang symbol (Taijitu), showing balance and the complement of men and women. On either side of this column of symbols is a long upright rectangle which serves as fortress walls which stabilizes and strengthens everything inside.\\nHistory of the Flag of Mongolia\\nThe flag of Mongolia has three vertical stripes: two side stripes in red and one blue in the middle.

However, the flag of the Soviet Mongolian’s People Republic was very similar with just one added element: a yellow five-point star over the soyombo.\\nFlag of Nepal\\nFlag of Nepal\\n3 colors: red, blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Nepal: It is said that the flag of Nepal foresees that the nation will last as long as the sun and moon are on earth. The blue part of the flag symbolizes peace; red represents the rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal. The curved moon stands for the royal house; the sun is for the Rana dynasty.\\nHistory of the Flag of Nepal\\nNepal is the only country in the world with a flag that’s not shaped as a rectangular or a square. It has the peculiar shape of two orthogonal triangles, stacked on top of each other, with blue borders.\\nThe top triangle has the silhouette of a moon, and the bottom triangle has a 12-point star that symbolizes the sun. The flag is actually the combination of two pennons used in Nepal from ancient times, probably going back over 2,000 years.\\nThe format was adopted after the unification of Nepal’s principalities led by Prithvi Narayan Shah, in the mid 16th century, but the current symbolism of the flag has evolved since then.\\nThe red is the same color as the rhododendron flower, Nepal’s national plant, and it represents the bravery of the Nepali people. The blue symbolizes peace and harmony and both colors are frequently seen together in everyday Nepali life, mostly for decoration and artistic purposes.\\nThe triangles in the flag also represent the Himalayas and the two most important families in the country’s History: the Shahs, represented by the top triangle, and the Ranas, represented by the bottom triangle.\\nAnother common interpretation connects both triangles to peace and hard work, but the official version relates them to the country’s two most important religions, Hinduism and Buddhism.\\nThe celestial bodies represent longevity. In addition to that, the moon not only symbolizes the calm nature and the pure soul of the Nepali people, but also the crisp air of the mountains, and the sun represents the Nepali bravery and the warmth of the country’s lower lands.\\nThe current flag was adopted on 16 December 1962, when a new constitutional government was inaugurated. At that time, they removed from the flag the human faces on the symbols of the moon and the sun.\\nFlag of North Korea\\nFlag of North Korea\\n2 colors: blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of North Korea: Red stands for the revolutionary ideals and the patriotic spirit shown by the country men during the fight for independence; blue represents the nation’s independence and people’s desire to maintain peaceful relations with the progressive nations of the world; white is for homogeneous nature, purity and transparency of the people of Korea. The white disk is a representation of the opposing principles of nature and also refers to the yin-yang symbol. This disk also refers, according to ancient traditions, to the traditional Korean T’aeguk, symbol of the universe. The red star represents Communism and the role of the Korean Workers Party in transforming the nation into a better economic and political power during the turbulent period of the Second Civil War.\\nHistory of the Flag of North Korea\\nThe flag of North Korea has three horizontal stripes: a wider red stripe in the center and two narrow blue stripes at the top and the bottom. Two thin white lines separate the red stripe from the blue stripes. Laid over the red stripe, on the left side of the flag, there’s a red five-point star inside a white circle.\\nThe flag’s design reveals the communist ideology that officially rules the country, but there’s a more precise interpretation of the elements on the flag of North Korea. The red symbolizes the blood that was shed by patriots, especially during the socialist fights. The blue symbolizes the desire for peace and white symbolizes purity and chastity.\\nAnother interpretation links red to patriotism and the determination of the North Koreans, and white to the ethnic purity of the Korean race and their culture.\\nThe official explanation, given by Kim Il-Sung, is:\\n” The red color of the flag symbolizes the anti-Japanese fervor, the red blood shed by the Korean patriots and the invincible might of our people firmly united to support the Republic. The white color symbolizes the one bloodline, one land, one language, one culture of our monoethnic country, which lived in purity. And blue stands for the gallant visage of our people, symbolizing the spirit of the Korean people fighting for world peace and progress. “\\nThe choice of the current flag was influenced by the Soviets, who occupied the country right after the Second World War. Without the Soviet pressure, the Korean communists would have probably chosen to keep the traditional flag of the Korean Empire, the one that’s still used today by South Korea.\\nIt’s not clear who designed the new flag of North Korea, but some people claim the Soviets did. It was presented on 1 May 1948 and officially adopted on 8 September of the same year.\\nFlag of Oman\\nFlag of Oman\\n3 colors: white, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Oman: Red is taken from Oman’s previous flag, representing the reigning Al Bu Said dynasty, also symbolizing the difficulties Oman overcame in its search for independence; white historically represents the imam, the Islamic religious leaders of the country and also represents peace and prosperity; green is the color of Islam and is also for the fertility of Oman as well as Al Jabal al Akhdar (the Green Mountains) in the north-east of the country.

On the left side, there’s a vertical stripe, slightly wider than the horizontal ones, also red. Together with the central red stripe, it resembles a red T laid horizontally.\\nThe national emblem is on the top left corner, in white, and it dates back to the 18th century. It’s the symbol of the Albusaidi Dynasty, with two swords that cross over a khanjar, a typical Arabian curbed dagger.\\nThe red is inherited from Oman’s traditional flags. The white symbolizes peace, and it’s traditionally associated with the Imam, Oman’s religious leader. The green symbolized the “Green Mountains,” a mountain range in the north.\\nUntil 1970, Oman used a simple red flag, which was common in the countries of that region. That year, the Sultan decided to give the country’s flag a little more personality and made the changes that we see today.\\nOfficially, the current flag was adopted on 25 April 1995, but that was actually the date when the small changes were implemented.\\nFlag of Pakistan\\nFlag of Pakistan\\n2 colors: white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Pakistan: The thin white stripe stands for the non-Muslim, religious minorities of Pakistan; the green larger part symbolizes the Islamic religion. The celestial symbols on the flag, the crescent and the star, represent progress, light and knowledge.\\nHistory of the Flag of Pakistan\\nThe flag of Pakistan has two vertical sections: a narrower white on the left and a wider dark green on the right.

Red represents the Khawarij, the Islamic group who formed the first republican party in the early days of Islam and the Arab tribes who participated in the conquest of North Africa and Andalusia. In modern times, red stands for the Ashrafs of the Hijaz and the Hashemites, descendants of the Prophet. Black is for revenge and the color of the headdress worn when leading troops into battle in the period of the Prophet Mohammad (570-632). Also, during the Abbasid Dynasty (750-1258), black was used as a symbol of mourning for the assassination of relatives of the Prophet and in remembrance of the Battle of Karbala. White was the symbolic color of the Umayyads, who ruled for ninety years in Damascus (661-750). Back then, white was a reminder of the Prophet’s first battle at Badr and a way to distinguish themselves from the Abbasids using this color to mourn. Green is used after the Fatimid Dynasty (909-1171) in North Africa, symbolizing their allegiance to Ali, the Prophet’s cousin, who was once wrapped in a green coverlet in place of the Prophet to frustrate an assassination attempt.\\nHistory of the Flag of Palestine\\nCOMING SOON\\nFlag of Philippines\\nFlag of Philippines\\n3 colors: blue, red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Philippines: Blue stands for the willingness to sacrifice oneself for freedom, peace, truth and justice; red signifies courage and patriotism; white stands for liberty, equality and fraternity.

When asked what kind of flag did he want for the first ship of his Navy, Tsar Alexander I left that decision up to the Dutchman and told him to do the same as he would do in his home country. Butler than created the Russian flag, that was very similar to the one of his own country.\\nOthers claim that Peter I ordered a warship from the Netherlands in 1694 and when he saw the flag on the ship, adopted the same template but changed the color sequence.\\nThere are, naturally, several interpretations of what the colors on the flag represent but the most popular one associates white with honesty and decency, blue with loyalty and chastity, and red with courage, generosity, and love.\\nFlag of Saudi Arabia\\nFlag of Saudi Arabia\\n2 colors: green, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Saudi Arabia: The background green color is the official color of Islam.

Between 1824 and 1891, and later between 1902 and 1921, the Crescent Moon was replaced by the inscription. The sword was introduced in 1921 but initially pointed to the right.

The Viscount of Béarn and the Bishop of Urgell are, historically, the two princes of Andorra but the President of France officially replaces the Viscount. Under the coat of arms, the motto “Virtue United is Stronger.”\\nFlag of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\nFlag of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Blue represents truth, dedication, justice, and integrity; yellow stands for liberality. The three points of the triangle symbolize the three nations of Bosnia: Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats. The white stars represent Europe.\\nHistory of the Flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\nThe flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina drifts away from the typical design of national flags. It has three colors: dark blue, yellow, and white. Blue is the primary color that doubles as the background for the overlaid elements: a slanted yellow triangle with the hypotenuse turned to the bottom left vertex of the flag, and a row of seven stars and two half-stars, one in each end. The right side of the flag is all blue, top to bottom.\\nThis flag didn’t have a historical past and was created by political convention in 1998, following peace brought by the Dayton Agreement and the creation of a new country. The vertexes of the triangle represent the three main groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Serbians, Croatians, and Bosniaks.\\nThe stars represent Europe and appear cut in both ends of the row to convey a sense of infinity intentionally. The blue also represents Europe, but all other colors represent neutrality and peace.\\nDuring the Civil War, the Bosniak majority used the coat of arms of the Kotromanić Dynasty (1377-1463) as their flag. After peace was restored, the country needed a flag with which the Serbians and the Croatians would also feel good about. Despite different options, that was never possible and the current flag was chosen and imposed by the United Nations High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nFlag of Croatia\\nFlag of Croatia\\n3 colors: red, white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Croatia: All three colors (red, white, blue) were taken from the flag of imperial Russia. In the flag of Croatia, red symbolizes the blood spilled in the fight for independence and the zeal and enthusiasm of the martyrs in fighting the colonial authorities; white represents the peaceful and amiable nature of Croatians; blue stands for belief in God. The national coat of arms in the center of the flag. The checkerboard of thirteen red and twelve white fields is a symbol of the Croatian Kings. It has a crown of shields of five historical regions which formed the Republic of Croatia: Croatia, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia.\\nHistory of the Flag of Croatia\\nThe flag of Croatia has three horizontal stripes, red, white, and blue, top to bottom. In the center, Croatia’s coat of arms: a white and red checkered pattern, crowned by the symbols of each one of the regions in the country, Croatia, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia (left to right).\\nThe choice of colors relates to Pan-Slavism and is common in different Slavic countries, including Russia. On the other hand, and this is hardly a coincidence, the same colors appear in the historical flags of the former kingdoms that are presently Croatia: the Kingdom of Croatia, Kingdom of Slavonia, and the Kingdom of Dalmatia.\\nThe current flag is not much different from the one used before in Croatia when it was part of the SFR Yugoslavia, except the past flag had a communist star instead of the coat of arms.\\nFlag of Italy\\nFlag of Italy\\n3 colors: green, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Italy: The red and white parts of the flag come from the official colors of the Milanese flag and the green represents the Civic Guards of Milan. Green represents hope and joy; white stands for peace and honesty; red depicts strength and courage. There is another theory for the colors in the Italian flag which attributes red to the violent struggle to become a unified and independent nation, green to the landscapes, white to the snow-capped Alps.\\nHistory of the Flag of Italy\\nItaly is one of the many countries that adopted the tricolored design of the French flag, with three same-sized vertical stripes. The flag of Italy has one green stripe on the left, one white stripe in the middle, and one red stripe on the right, and it’s very easily confused with the Mexican flag.\\nThe Italian tricolor flag was brought to what would be Italy by Napoleon in 1796, with many speculating about the meaning of the color green, which replaces the blue in the French flag. Some claim it represents the green island of Corsica, Napoleon’s homeland, while others claim it’s linked to the Milan militia uniforms or the color of Lombardy.\\nIt was the flag of the Cispadane Republic in 1797, but some records show that set of colors was adopted before in 1794, by a group of revolutionary students at the University of Bologna. That is, however, a controversial possibility.\\nWhatever the origin, the Italian tricolor has been in use since the end of the 19th century with some variations. The current design has been the official flag since 1948.\\nFlag of Serbia\\nFlag of Serbia\\n3 colors: red, blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Serbia: The colors blue, white and red of the flag of Serbia are the ones in the conventional Slavic color schemes, named Pan-Slavonic shades. They were inspired by the flag of Independent Russia.\\nHistory of the Flag of Serbia\\nThis is one of the Slavic countries that has a flag clearly inspired by the Pan-Slavic movement, with a color scheme that reminds us of the Russian flag. Since all is connected, we have to dig deeper and pinpoint the origin of the Russian flag in the Netherlands, a country with one of the oldest flags in the world.\\nThe flag of Serbia has three colors in three horizontal stripes: red on top, blue in the middle, and white on the bottom. When compared with the flags of other countries that follow the Pan-Slavic movement, the colors are reversed.\\nDespite the connection to the movement that exists in several Slavic countries, the fact is that the flag of Vladislav I, who ruled in the mid-13th century, looks a lot like the current Serbian flag, except for the missing white stripe and the coat of arms. In the 14th century, the two-headed eagle associated with the Serbian Empire was added.\\nThe flag has a coat of arms in the center, with a white two-headed eagle over a red background and a shield with a golden crown.\\nDespite Serbia’s long history, it’s one of the most recent flags in the world. It was adopted formally in 2004, but it looks like a natural evolution from previous flags of independent Yugoslavia and independent Serbia during the Ottoman Empire (1815) and the end of the World War I (1918).\\nFlag of Slovakia\\nFlag of Slovakia\\n3 colors: white, blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Slovakia: Blue, white and red are conventional Slavonic shades which represent Slavonic harmony and independence. The coat of arms is an adapted edition of the Hungarian coat of arms, symbolizing Slovakia’s previous connection with that country. The cross of the arms stands for Christianity and the mountains represent the Mountains as Tatra, Fatra, and Matra.\\nHistory of the Flag of Slovakia\\nThe flag of Slovakia is one more of the flags based on the colors of the Pan-Slavic movement, inspired by the Russian flag.\\nIt has three colors in three horizontal stripes: white on top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. The ancient Slovakian national symbol is placed in the middle on the left side and consists of a double white cross over three hills. The background is red and the hills are blue, meaning that the colors in the coat of arms match the ones in the flag stripes. That representation depicts the emerging of Christianity in the Carpathian region.\\nThe flag first appeared, without the coat of arms, in the revolutionary period of 1848, when the Slavic regions, which were a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were swept by a series of nationalist movements adopting the colors of Russia as their own (the only independent Slavic nation at that time).\\nAfter World War I and the dissolution of the Empire, Slovakia and the regions that are now part of the Czech Republic became Czechoslovakia. After the end of the communist regime in that country in 1989, began a separation process that was finished in 1993.\\nAs a part of that process, then Minister of Internal Affairs commissioned a new flag to local flag artists Ladislav Čisárik and Ladislav Vrtel in 1990. , but when the flag was approved on 1 March 1990, it didn’t include the symbol, just the three colors. In 1992, the symbol was added to avoid mistakes with the flag of Slovenia and Russia.\\nFlag of Slovenia\\nFlag of Slovenia\\n3 colors: white, blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Slovenia: White, blue and red are traditional Slavic colors initially adopted by Slavic nations influenced by the Russian flag, an independent Slavic country then. The coat of arms of Slovenia has three stars representing independence. The two wavy blue lines at the bottom of the mountain symbolize the country’s rivers which flow into the sea.\\nHistory of the Flag of Slovenia\\ncoming soon…\\nFlag of Spain\\nFlag of Spain\\n2 colors: red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Spain: The red and yellow are probably originated in one of the original coats of Spanish kingdoms: Castile, Leon, Catalonia/Aragon, Navarre. In the Spanish flag itself, the coat of arms has two crown-topped pillars of Hercules representing Gibraltar and Ceuta with red banners displaying the motto in Latin, “PLUS ULTRA” (“More Beyond”), in reference to Columbus’ discovery of the New World. The four quarters of the shield show the badges of the original Spanish Kingdoms. In the center is the emblem of the reigning Spanish Royal Family, House of Bourbon, a blue oval with a red-edged border containing three fleurs-de-lis. The pomegranate at the bottom of the shield represents Grenada.\\nHistory of the Flag of Spain\\ncoming soon…\\nFlag of Cyprus\\nFlag of Cyprus\\n3 colors: white, orange, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Cyprus: The white field of the background has a copper-orange island in the center, representing the abundance of copper ore in the country. Under the island, there are two olive branches which symbolize the peace and harmony which the country has been trying to negotiate between the Greek and the Turkish communities. That is why the Constitution of Cyprus forbids the use of a cross or crescent and blue (Greek) and red (Turkish) colors in the Cypriot flag.\\nHistory of the Flag of Cyprus\\nFlag of Portugal\\nFlag of Portugal\\n3 colors: green, red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Portugal: Red represents the Portuguese uprising in 1910; green symbolizes optimism. The coat of arms with Portugal’s conventional shield includes Five blue shields representing the conquest over five Moresque kings and the five dots and cross signify Christianity. There is a navigation device at the back of the coats of arms to represent Prince Henry the Navigator, who initiated the marine expedition of Portugal.\\nHistory of the Flag of Portugal\\nThe flag of Portugal is divided into two main areas: a smaller green area on the left and a larger red area on the right. In the center, where both colors come together, there’s a unique symbol with an armillary sphere (associated with one of the most important times for the country, the Age of Discoveries) and Portugal’s coat of arms, a connection between the monarchy that ended in 1910 and the new age of the Republic.\\nThe five blue shields represent the five wounds of Christ and the seven castles represent the military victories when the country was created.\\nThe primary colors before the Republic were light blue and white since then replaced by the current ones.\\nThe new flag of Portugal was hoisted for the first time at Praça dos Restauradores in Lisbon and adopted on 1 December 1910. A committee chose the new symbol of Portugal under the direction of João Chagas, that included members like painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, journalist João Chagas, and writer Abel Coelho. After studying several options, they chose the current flag.\\nHowever, the colors were only interpreted during the Estado Novo era. At that time the green officially became a representation of hope and the red represented the blood shed in the name of the country.\\nFlag of San Marino\\nFlag of San Marino\\n2 colors: white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of San Marino: Blue represents the sky; white stands for the mountains and snow on the top of Mt. Titano, San Marino’s highest point. The coat of arms in the center has a shield, flanked by a wreath, a crown underneath and on top a scroll bearing the word “Libertas” (liberty).\\nHistory of the Flag of San Marino\\nThis small republic in the middle of Italy has a flag with two horizontal stripes: one white on the top and one light blue on the bottom, with the San Marino coat of arms in the center. The coat of arms has three towers, each one of them decorated with an ostrich feather. Those are in fact the towers in the San Marino castle, called Guaita, Cesta, and Montale.\\nThere’s a golden crown over the tower, a symbol of the country’s autonomy and independence, and the coat of arms is circled by a wreath of laurel and oak, with just one word underneath: Libertas, which means Freedom.\\nThe colors of the flag, white and blue, represent peace and freedom respectively.\\nSan Marino is an ancient political territory and already had a flag in 1465, although it’s entirely different from the current one. The current flag was adopted on 6 April 1862, with practically no changes since then.\\nFlag of Greece\\nFlag of Greece\\n2 colors: blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Greece: Blue and white refer to the sky and sea and the Greek cultural heritage. These colors were probably used to represent Greek gods and goddesses like Achilles and Athena, as well as during Byzantine and Ottoman rule. The blue and white cross symbolizes the Greek religion, Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The nine stripes stand for the syllables in the Greek saying, “Freedom or Death” (Eleftheria i thanatos), the nine letters in the Greek word for “freedom” (Eleftheria), and also perhaps the traditional nine Greek Muses.\\nHistory of the Flag of Greece\\nThe beginnings of the modern Greek flag date back to 1821, when the Greek independentists hoisted a blue flag with a white cross, as opposed to the flag with a crescent moon of the Ottoman Empire. That flag, simpler then, developed into the current design and was adopted as a national flag in 1822. The original flag was blue with a white cross. The new flag had a smaller cross in the top left corner and four white stripes and five blue stripes. It’s said the flag has as many stripes as the nine syllables of the motto “Eleftheria i Thanatos,” which means “Freedom or Death” in Greek. Some claim it’s one stripe for each letter in the word “Freedom” (in Greek, of course), while others claim each stripe stands for each one of the nine muses.\\nHistorically speaking, there are many possible stories to explain the roots of this flag, but none of them have been proved. The powerful Cretan family Kallergis used the same flag, inspired by the Byzantine emperor Nicephorus II Phocas, who ruled at the end of the 10th century.\\nThe blue represents the sky and the ocean, a symbol of Greece and its islands, and the white represents the pure intentions of the independentists revolutionaries.\\nThe cross represents the importance of the Orthodox Church in Greek society and its role in preserving national unity even under the long Ottoman occupation.\\nThe shade of blue has been changed several times over the years, but the Greeks still call their flag “Galanolefci” (blue and white).\\nFlag of the Vatican\\nFlag of the Vatican\\n2 colors: yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of the Vatican: Yellow and white represent the gold and silver of the crossed keys of Saint Peter, also shown in the flag. Yellow symbolizes the religious strength of the pope; white shows his universal authority. The two keys underneath the papal tiara are the keys to heaven, connected by a red cord.\\nHistory of the Flag of the Vatican\\nFlags of Western Europe\\nFlag of Austria\\nFlag of Austria\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Austria: The red and white colors on the Austria Flag symbolize the white coat worn by the Duke of Austria during a battle, which was soaked in blood after the fight.\\nHistory of the Flag of Austria\\nThe flag of Austria is one of the oldest in the world, and it’s easy to identify: three stripes stacked horizontally, with one white stripe in the middle and two red stripes in the top and the bottom. Its origin is based on the legend of when Duke Leopold V took part on a military expedition to the Holy Land. It’s been told that he fought so fiercely in the Siege of Acre (1291) that his white shirt was completely soaked in red blood, except for the middle part under his belt. After the battle, the duke realized he had lost his flag, and hoisted his shirt in its place.\\nFact or fiction, what matters is that the descendant of the duke adopted the same colors for the flag in the 13th century. If you want a more pragmatic approach to the history of this flag, it’s best to deep dive into the complex history of medieval heraldry, and the connections to the family of Duke Ottokar IV of Styria, which in turn may have been inspired by the banner of Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia (11th century).\\nFlag of Belgium\\nFlag of Belgium\\n3 colors: black, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Belgium: All the colors in the Belgium flag (black, yellow and red) represent the country’s coat of arms. Black symbolizes the shield; yellow is for the lion; red stands for the lion’s claws and tongue.\\nHistory of the Flag of Belgium\\nThe flag of Belgium has three vertical stripes in three colors, black on the left, yellow in the middle, and red on the right. Those are the colors of the Duchy of Brabant, the same used during the failed Brabant Revolution (1789-1790).\\nThe Belgian flag with the current colors appeared almost spontaneously after the events of the Brussels Opera (25 August 1830), when the French flag was removed from Brussels and replaced by one very similar to the present flag of Belgium. The only difference was that the stripes were horizontal rather than vertical, as they are today.\\nAfter the country became independent, the flag remained, changed later to the current design allegedly to avoid similarities with the Dutch flag. On 12 October 1831, the final Belgian flag became official.\\nThe proportions of the flag of Belgium are somewhat odd, with a 13:15 ratio.\\nFlag of France\\nFlag of France\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of France: The tricolor flag in present days is a combination of the national color of France, white, with the blue and red of the French militia after the French Revolution.\\nHistory of the Flag of France\\nThe flag of France has three vertical stripes of the same width, one blue on the left, one white in the middle, and one red on the right. This graphic design was the inspiration of many other flags over the centuries, mostly in European countries but also in different continents.\\nThe colors in the French flag date back to the revolutionary movement at the end of the 18th century. At that time, blue, white, and red were adopted by the revolutionaries fighting the end of the monarchy in France, taking over the Bastille, and freeing the political prisoners. That day is usually associated with the birth of modern, republican France.\\nThe blue and the red were symbolic colors of Paris, associated with Saint Denis and Saint Martin. The white, a traditional color of the French monarchy, was added to give the flag a national, all-embracing touch. On the other hand, you can also link the three colors to the three words of the revolutionary motto: blue for freedom, white for equality, and red for fraternity.\\nThe current flag, known as “Tricolore” (French for tricolor), has been used as it is since 1794, with a small interruption from 1815 to 1830.\\nFlag of Liechtenstein\\nFlag of Liechtenstein\\n2 colors: blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Liechtenstein: Blue symbolizes the radiant sky; red represents the embers in the fireplace during evening gatherings. The crown shows that the people, country, and the princely House are all united in their hearts and spirits.\\nHistory of the Flag of Liechtenstein\\nThe flag of Liechtenstein is split into two horizontal halves, a top blue one and a red bottom one. The blue represents the sky and the red symbolizes the fires lit in the evenings.\\nA crown was added in 1937 so that Liechtenstein wasn’t mistaken by Haiti in the Berlin Olympic Games. The Caribbean country’s flag looked precisely the same. The gold crown stands for the physical and spiritual unity of the small nation, the State, and the ruling family.\\nAlthough the flag has been used since Liechtenstein became an independent country in 1719, it wasn’t until 1921 that the current design was formally approved.\\nFlag of Luxembourg\\nFlag of Luxembourg\\n3 colors: red, white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Luxembourg: The colors red, white, and blue probably came from the coat of arms of Luxembourg’s counts and dukes. The selected blue is aimed at differentiating this flag from that of the Netherlands.\\nHistory of the Flag of Luxembourg\\nThe flag of Luxembourg has three colors in three same-sized horizontal stripes: top red, middle white, and bottom light blue. It’s a color combination very close to the one you’ll find in the flag of the Netherlands, which is explained by the connection between the two countries in the 19th century.\\nLuxembourg became independent in 1867, but the current flag was only adopted in 1972 and included the same colors as the ones in the Grand-Duke’s coat of arms. The colors of the flag had been informally used since 1830, anyway, and the current flag first appeared in 1848, unofficially.\\nFlag of Germany\\nFlag of Germany\\n3 colors: black, red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Germany: Black and yellow were the colors of the Holy Roman Emperor’s flag around the tenth century. The Austrian Empire incorporated these colors in their flag. The colors black, red and yellow were used in the uniforms of German soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars (black coats with red braids and golden buttons). The colors’ symbols can be read in the sentence: “Out of the blackness of servitude [black], through bloody battles [red] to the golden light of freedom [yellow].”\\nHistory of the Flag of Germany\\nThe flag of Germany has been changed many times in the course of the country’s history and there are two sets of colors associated with the nation and that compete with one another. The one we can see on the flag today, black, gold, and red, and a second one of black, red, and white.\\nThe current color scheme first appeared in 1778 and became especially relevant during the revolutionary movements in 1848. The Frankfurt Parliament proposed a flag with those three colors, part of an attempt between 1848 and 1850 to establish a unified and democratic Germany with a constitutional monarchy.\\nThere are several theories behind the colors and their origin. They might be related to the colors of the Jena Students’ League or with the uniforms of the Lützow Free Corps. Whatever the reason, the colors are always linked to liberal and reformist political forces.\\nThe current flag was adopted after World War I when the Weimar Republic was established. Nazis taking over power meant the temporary end of the flag, that returned after the World War II in both German countries: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), controlled by the Soviet Union. In 1959, East Germany added its national coat of arms to the flag, which included communist symbols.\\nAfter the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s, the Western Germany flag became the official flag for the country.\\nFlags of Eastern Europe\\nFlag of Romania\\nFlag of Romania\\n3 colors: blue, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Romania: The red, blue and white colors represent the two princedoms as Walachia and Moldavia, which unified to constitute Romania in the year of 1859.\\nHistory of the Flag of Romania\\nThe flag of Romania has three colors in three vertical stripes: a dark blue one on the left, a yellow in the middle, and a red on the right.\\nThese colors have been the colors of the main regions of Romania, Wallachia, and Moldova, from a long time. The flag was adopted for the first time in 1834, in Wallachia. However, it underwent some changes, and the version you see at the hands of the revolutionaries in 1848 has the same colors but in three horizontal stripes.\\nThat year, probably influenced by the French flag, the Romanian flag was defined but not used for a long time since the revolution was hushed.\\nThe flag used in 1866 and 1948 looked a lot like the current one, but with a communist symbol in the middle that was included in 1948 and stayed until 1989. After the end of communism in the country, it was frequent to see flags with a hole in the middle because the people wanted to get rid of the symbol of a regime they were trying to defeat.\\nThere’s not an official explanation of the flag’s colors, so the interpretation of the flag of Romania is entirely subjective. A possible interpretation links the blue to freedom, the yellow to justice, and the red to fraternity.\\nFlag of Russia\\nFlag of Russia\\n3 colors: white, blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Russia: The Russian Federation flag contains the Pan-Slavic colors of red, blue and white. Since there is no official meaning appointed to the colors by the Russian government, several theories exist. One refers that the colors came from the Grand Duchy of Moscow and depict Saint George in a silver armor, on a white horse, wearing a blue cap on a red field. Another theory explains that white represents God, blue is for Tsar and red for peasants. Even another theory attributes white to a bright future, blue for clouded present and red for the bloody past.\\nHistory of the Flag of Russia\\nThe current flag of Russia has three horizontal stripes: one white on the top, one blue in the middle, and one red on the bottom. The color scheme is associated with the Pan-Slavic movement and can be seen across many Slavic countries including Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Serbia.\\nAlthough this is the traditional flag of Russia, from 1917 to 1991, during the communist era, the Soviet Union had a red flag with the traditional communist symbol, the sickle and the hammer, in gold on the top left corner.\\nIn 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the communist regime, the traditional Russian flag was reinstated.\\nRussia had officially adopted the current flag in 1696, probably inspired by the flag of the Netherlands, one of the oldest flags in the world.\\nSome say the flag appeared for the first time because of the Dutch shipbuilder, Butler, in charge of building the first Russian warship, Oryol. When asked what kind of flag did he want for the first ship of his Navy, Tsar Alexander I left that decision up to the Dutchman and told him to do the same as he would do in his home country. Butler than created the Russian flag, that was very similar to the one of his own country.\\nOthers claim that Peter I ordered a warship from the Netherlands in 1694 and when he saw the flag on the ship, adopted the same template but changed the color sequence.\\nThere are, naturally, several interpretations of what the colors on the flag represent but the most popular one associates white with honesty and decency, blue with loyalty and chastity, and red with courage, generosity, and love.\\nFlag of Armenia\\nFlag of Armenia\\n3 colors: red, blue, orange.\\nMeaning of the flag of Armenia: Red symbolizes the blood spilt by Armenian soldiers in war, maintenance of the Christian faith, Armenia’s independence and freedom; blue represents the will of the people of Armenia to live in peaceful skies; orange stands for the creative talent and hard working nature of the people of this country.\\nHistory of the Flag of Armenia\\nFlag of Belarus\\nFlag of Belarus\\n3 colors: white, red, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Belarus: Green represents the future, spring, hope, revival and the forests and fields of the country; red symbolizes the bloodshed in the past to achieve independence. The decorative pattern on the side represents Belarus’ rich cultural heritage, its spiritual continuity and the unity of its people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Belarus\\nThe flag of Belarus was adopted in 2012, following a design approved in the referendum of May 1995. The flag is split into three areas: the larger areas are two stripes stacked horizontally, one larger red on top of one narrower green. On the left side is the third section of the flag, a narrow vertical stripe decorated with a traditional Belarus pattern.\\nIt’s not much different from the flag of the Byelorussian SSR, formerly part of the Soviet Union. That flag was created in 1951 and the main differences were the communist symbols, such as the sickle and hammer and the five-point star. In addition to that, the traditional pattern had a lot more red than white.\\nRight after Belarus rose as a country in 1991, they hoisted the flag used before they were part of the Soviet Union, which was primarily white with a horizontal red stripe in the middle.\\nA final note about the traditional pattern: it was created in 1917 by Matrona Markevich, who was inspired by local plants and flowers. The original design didn’t make it to the present time, probably confiscated or destroyed by local authorities during World War II. Those patterns were embroidered and used on special occasions.\\nFlag of Bulgaria\\nFlag of Bulgaria\\n3 colors: white, green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bulgaria: Green represents agriculture and greenery; white and red derived from the flag of Russia.\\nHistory of the Flag of Bulgaria\\nThe current flag of Bulgaria was adopted in 1991 after the communist regime fell. However, it’s not much different from the previous flag that was already a variation of the national flag defined in 1878, when Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire.\\nThat year, they wrote the Tarnovo Constitution where you can read the description of the new flag on article 23: “The Bulgarian people’s flag is three-colored and consists of white, green and red colors, placed horizontally.”\\nThis meaning of the colors can be loosely interpreted. The white might represent peace, love, and freedom, green might represent the country’s soil fertility, and the red might represent the fight for independence and bravery.\\nA communist regime ruled Bulgaria from 1944 to 1990, which added this symbol to the flag: a lion encircled by wheat and with a small five-point star over it. The colors and details of this symbol were slightly changed during the communist period.\\nFlag of Czech Republic\\nFlag of Czech Republic\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Czech Republic: The colors used in the flag are those traditional of the region of Bohemia. White symbolizes the honest and peaceful nature of the people of the Czech Republic; red represents courage and noble patriotic spirit; blue stands for the Czech virtues of vigilance, truth, loyalty, perseverance.\\nHistory of the Flag of Czech Republic\\nThe flag of the Czech Republic has two stripes stacked horizontally, the top one is white, and the bottom one is red, and a blue triangle on the left laid horizontally resembling an arrow.\\nThe flag exists since 1920, and it’s the second flag of independent Czechoslovakia that rose from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. Between that year and 1920, the country used a flag with a simple design, with two stripes stacked horizontally, white on top and red on the bottom, the same flag as the Kingdom of Bohemia that was part of the empire at the time. That means the current flag is based on that one, to which they added the blue portion in 1920.\\nAt the time of the communist ruling (1948-1989), the flag remained unchanged. When Czechoslovakia split, Czech Republic kept the old national flag while Slovakia created a new one, although the legal terms clearly stated that none of the countries could use common symbolic heritage after the separation.\\nThe flag stands for national union, and the Czech Republic is, in fact, a group of three regions: Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. It’s said that the blue that used to represent Slovakia now represents Moravia in the new flag. It’s also meant as a symbol of truth, loyalty, and the Czech’s determined and fair nature. The white represents peace and the red represents strength.\\nFlag of Georgia\\nFlag of Georgia\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Georgia: The flag of Georgia features a white background with a large red St. George’s Cross-centered over it representing the Georgian kingdom in the 5th century. In each of the four white rectangles created by the cross, there are 4 more red Blonisi crosses. All the crosses probably represent the five Holy Wounds that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion.\\nHistory of the Flag of Georgia\\nThe flag of Georgia is very distinguishable with a white background and a red St. George’s cross, like the one used in the English flag, splitting the flag into four sections. On each of the four sections, there are smaller crosses, also red.\\nThe origin of this flag is a political one: it used to be the flag of the National Movement, led by President Saakashvili, who became the leader of the country after the Revolution of Roses in 2002. However, the flag goes back at least to the 14th century, when a Franciscan monk described it as the flag of the kingdom of Georgia.\\nThis is the last flag of several different flags used by Georgia in the last 120 years. In the 20th century alone, Georgia had seven flags including the ones imposed by the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the USSR and independence, Georgia began to use a mainly dark red flag, but it was never a popular option because it was always associated to the chaos and turmoil that followed independence.\\nThe current flag was adopted officially on 24 January 2004, and it’s one of the most recent flags in the world.\\nFlag of Hungary\\nFlag of Hungary\\n3 colors: red, white, green.\\nMeaning of the flag of Hungary: Red represents valor and the noble patriotic spirit of the Hungarian people during the fight for independence, which caused significant bloodshed; white is for the faithful nature of Hungarians; green stands for agriculture and the hope for a better future.\\nHistory of the Flag of Hungary\\nThe flag of Hungary has three equally sized horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and green on the bottom.\\nThe flag first appeared in 1848 during the national freedom movement against the Habsburg Empire and was inspired by the tricolor design of the French flag.\\nAt that time, the colors meant the following: white represented freedom and loyalty, red represented strength and the blood shed for the country, and the green represented hope and land. The new Constitution, approved in 2012, defines what each color of the flag stands for strength, loyalty, and hope.\\nFlag of Kazakhstan\\nFlag of Kazakhstan\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kazakhstan: The solid blue background means peace and unity of people living in Kazakhstan, as well as the infinite, pure sky. The sun represents the source of life and energy but is also a symbol of progress and movement for nomads. The silhouette of the sun is a symbol of well-being and abundance. 32 beams come out of the sun, shaped like a grain to symbolize abundance and prosperity. The eagle represents the power of the state and astuteness. Also, for people living in the steppe, this bird of prey symbolizes independence, freedom, aspiration and, at the same time, strength to overcome any obstacles and difficulties. The ornament on the left identifies the culture and traditions of Kazakhstan.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kazakhstan\\nThe flag of Kazakhstan is mainly light blue with a yellow symbol in the center: a steppe eagle, known locally as berkut, flying under a sun with 32 beams.\\nOn the left side, there’s a national pattern of Kazakhstan in yellow across the flag from top to bottom.\\nThe shade of blue used in the flag is common among the nomadic people of Central Asia and has been always present in the flags of Kazakhstan. In the flag, it represents peace, freedom, ethnic and cultural union of all the people living in the country, that form a more significant, more complicated cluster of six different groups. The sun symbolizes energy and life, abundance and wealth. The eagle symbolizes the State, as a pillar of national independence, freedom, and an enabler of great flights towards the future.\\nAlthough it’s a recent national flag, it’s inspired by ancient traditional symbols. It’s likely that the flag of the Kazakh Khanate wasn’t much different and had the same shade of blue. Even when the country was part of the Soviet Union the flag had a stripe with that same color, and over the centuries the flags of different tribes in the area featured a golden eagle.\\nThe current flag was officially adopted on 4 June 1992, about two years after the country’s post-Soviet Union independence.\\nFlag of Kosovo\\nFlag of Kosovo\\n3 colors: blue, ochre, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kosovo: The starts represent the six regions in the country and the ochre shape is the shape of its territory.\\nHistory of the Flag of Kosovo\\nThe flag of Kosovo looks complicated but is quite simple: it has a blue background, with the outline of the country’s map overlaid, and six white five-point stars that represent the ethnic and religious groups that live there (Albanian, Serbs, Turks, Gorani, Romani, and Bosniaks). Some claim the stars stand for something else, more complicated to explain: the six regions of what would be a Grand Albania, which would include current Albania, Kosovo, parts of contemporary Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece and the Preševo valley in the south of Serbia.\\nThe United Nations started a competition that had almost 1,000 applications, and the current flag was the winner, becoming the country’s official flag. It was hoisted on 17 February 2008, when the independence of Kosovo was officially declared, to replace the UN flag that was used temporarily. Muhamer Ibrahimi designed the current flag.\\nFlag of North Macedonia\\nFlag of North Macedonia\\n2 colors: red, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of North Macedonia: Red and yellow on the flag take back to early Macedonian history and exist on the country’s coat of arms, which dates back to the middle ages. The centered sun in the flag has rays which go into each corner of the flag to depict “the new sun of Liberty” of the new Republic of Macedonia.\\nHistory of the Flag of North Macedonia\\nThe flag of Macedonia has a graphic image of the sun, with a central circle with eight sunbeams. The background is red and the sun is represented in yellow.\\nThe current flag, designed by professor Miroslav Grčev, was selected from several applications in 1995, to replace another flag that had been adopted after the country became independent in 1992.\\nThat first flag was equally red, with an old sun symbol in the center, a representation of Ancient Greece. That flag had to be replaced due to diplomatic pressure from Greece, that claimed that symbol was exclusively Greek and to only be used by Greek Macedonia.\\nThe flag’s symbol is connected to Macedonia’s national anthem and this specific verse: “Today, the new sun of freedom is born over Macedonia. The Macedonians will fight for their own rights”.\\nFlag of Malta\\nFlag of Malta\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Malta: The white and red colors in the flag of Malta was taken from the checkered banner of Count Roger of Sicily. Another explanation claims that these two colors are those of the Knights of Saint John, who ruled Malta from the 16th to the 18th century. The cross at the upper left corner was awarded in 1942 by King George VI of the United Kingdom to the inhabitants of Malta for their exceptional bravery and audacity in World War II.\\nHistory of the Flag of Malta\\nThe flag of this small Mediterranean country is divided into two, half white (left) and half red (right). In addition to that, there’s a George Cross on the top left corner with the inscription in English “For Gallantry,” a distinction given to Malta by the United Kingdom for their stoic resistance to World War II bombings.\\nThe flag was adopted right after the country’s independence in 1964 and was inspired by the flag of the Norman family Hauteville, who conquered the island in the 11th century. According to the legend, when returning to Normandy Roger de Hauteville gave the Maltese a piece of his flag as recognition for taking part in the fight against the Muslims. That ripped piece of fabric looked like the flag’s current design.\\nIt’s most likely, however, that the Malta flag was inspired by the influence of the Knights of the Order of Malta in the country’s history. The Order’s flag was red with a white cross, that determined the flag on the island during British ruling.\\nFlag of Moldova\\nFlag of Moldova\\n3 colors: blue, yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Moldova: The colors in the flag represent those in the country’s coat of arms, which also lies in the middle. This coat of arms has an eagle holding a shield on its breast, a cross in its beak, an olive branch in the right claw and a scepter in the left claw. On the shield, there is a decorated picture of aurochs.\\nHistory of the Flag of Moldova\\nThere’s a clear connection between the flags of Moldova and of Romania, which is only natural considering the bonds between both countries. It’s a three-colored flag with vertical stripes, blue on the left, yellow in the middle, and red on the right. That is the same description for the flag of Romania.\\nThe difference in the flag of Moldova is the national coat of arms, in the center, over the yellow band: a golden eagle, carrying a small cross on its beak, decorated with the image of a bison conveying the idea of strength and power, and holding an olive branch, a symbol of peace, and a scepter. One small detail: the blue is slightly darker in the Romanian flag.\\nThe current flag was adopted in 1990 after the Soviet Union collapsed and the country became independent.\\nFlag of Monaco\\nFlag of Monaco\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Monaco: The red and white were chosen after the heraldic colors of the ruling Grimaldi family. They appear as a diamond-shaped pattern on the shield of the family’s coat of arms.\\nHistory of the Flag of Monaco\\nThe flag of the Monaco principality is divided into two halves, stacked horizontally. The top is red and the bottom is white. The colors are the same as the Grimaldi family, dating back to the 14th century, which reflects the influence of that family on Monaco.\\nThat connection was forgotten for a long time because of the ownership of lands that now belong to Monaco: after the revolution, France annexed Monaco and it became part of Sardinia. It returned to France in 1861 as an independent state. The current flag was officially adopted by Prince Charles III on 4 April 1861. The flag is very similar to the Indonesian one, a choice to which Monaco strongly opposed to in 1945.\\nFlag of Montenegro\\nFlag of Montenegro\\n2 colors: yellow, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Montenegro: The red field is bordered by a narrow yellow stripe with the Montenegrin coat of arms centered, consisting of a crowned double-headed golden eagle which symbolizes the unity of church and state. The eagle holds a golden scepter in its right claw and a blue orb in its left; the breast shield over the eagle has a golden lion on a green field in front of a blue sky (the lion is the symbol of episcopal authority, who ruled Montenegro for three and a half centuries.\\nHistory of the Flag of Montenegro\\nThe flag of Montenegro is red, with a gold frame, and the national symbol, mainly gold too, in the center: a two-headed eagle with a crown, a royal sphere in one claw and a scepter in the other claw. It holds a shield with a lion over a blue and green background.\\nThe flag seems to have been inspired by the flag of the powerful Petrovic family, used as a national symbol from 1852 to 1905. After that date, and after a series of political changes, all Montenegro symbols adopted the Pan-Slavic colors (red, blue, and white). The process to adopt the current flag started in 2004 and ended in 2006.\\nFlag of the Netherlands\\nFlag of the Netherlands\\n3 colors: red, white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Netherlands: The red (originally orange and then changed for unclear reasons), white and blue colors are based on the heraldic colors (coat of arms) of Prince William of Orange, the leader of the fight for Dutch independence.\\nHistory of the Flag of the Netherlands\\nThe flag of the Netherlands, also known as “Prince’s Flag,” has three colors in three horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and blue on the bottom. It strongly resembles the flag of Luxembourg.\\nThe background story of this flag is peculiar: there are records showing its use by William Prince of Orange in 1572 while fighting the Spanish. At the time, and following the family’s tradition, the top stripe was orange and not red. The change came later when the Dutch ships sailed out to explore the world and orange wasn’t a highly noticeable color at sea. In addition to that, the orange tended to turn red, so the color was eventually replaced.\\nFun fact: most people think that the French flag was the inspiration for all other tricolored flags, but the Dutch flag is the oldest of them all. The Dutch flag inspired the French and the Russian flags, and the latter passed on this influence to Slavic countries’ flags. The flag of the Netherlands is one of the oldest flags in the world.\\nAfter being used for centuries, the flag was only made official by a royal decree in 1937, when the flag’s meaning was also defined.\\nFlag of Poland\\nFlag of Poland\\n2 colors: white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Poland: White represents peace and morality; red symbolizes endurance, gallantry, vigor, and bravery. These colors were chosen after the coat of arms of Poland.\\nHistory of the Flag of Poland\\nThe flag of Poland is simple: two same-sized horizontal stripes, one white on top and one red on the bottom.\\nIt’s a simplification of the old symbol of Poland, that dates back to the medieval times, of a white eagle over a red background.\\nThe meaning of the colors can be loosely interpreted. Some say it represents an eagle flying over the sunset or it’s a symbol of the connection between the nationalist spirit and the blood shed when defending the country. In the communist era, the flag was interpreted as a symbol of the Polish people desire to live in peace and socialism.\\nFor many centuries, several versions of the flag were used in association with the idea of a Polish nation, almost always in white and red, and sometimes blue. The current flag’s design began to take shape in 1916, as protests for Poland’s independence grew.\\nThe country became independent in 1918, but the flag would only be officially adopted over one year later on 1 August 1919. Some superficial changes were made in 1980.\\nFlag of Switzerland\\nFlag of Switzerland\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Switzerland: The flag of Switzerland is based on the one of the Canton of Schwyz, one of the first three of this nation. The style was common in medieval times since it has a red square with a symmetric white cross in the center. The Switzerland national flag represents freedom, honor, and fidelity.\\nHistory of the Flag of Switzerland\\nFlag of Turkey\\nFlag of Turkey\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Turkey: As mentioned in the Holy Koran, the star in the flag of Turkey symbolizes the Morning Star. Both the white crescent and the star are symbols of Islam.\\nHistory of the Flag of Turkey\\nFlag of Ukraine\\nFlag of Ukraine\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ukraine: Blue symbolizes the colors of the sky, streams, and mountains of Ukraine; yellow represents the abundant golden wheat fields of the country.\\nHistory of the Flag of Ukraine\\nFlags of Northern Europe\\nFlag of Latvia\\nFlag of Latvia\\n2 colors: burgundy, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Latvia: White represents right and truth, the honor of free citizens and trustworthiness; burgundy is for the bloodshed in the past.\\nHistory of the Flag of Latvia\\nThe Latvian flag has three horizontal stripes, the middle one is white, and the other two are the same color, a kind of crimson. The bands don’t have the same size: the white is much narrower.\\nThe primary color is usually associated with the Latvians willingness to shed their blood for freedom, while white represents justice, honor, and truth. According to a local legend, a Latvian warrior wounded in battle was wrapped in a white sheet, and his blood stained the cloth, thus creating the flag. A similar story with the Austrian flag.\\nIt’s one of the national flags that is part of that limited group of flags that date back to the Middle Ages. It’s been used in battles at least since 1273, as a collection of old chronicles, the Livländische Reimchronik, confirms.\\nThe current flag was based on that former flag, created in 1917 by Ansis Cīrulis and chosen to represent independent Latvia in 1921. While Latvia was a part of the Soviet Union, the traditional flag was banned and only returned after the independence in 1991.\\nFlag of Lithuania\\nFlag of Lithuania\\n3 colors: yellow, green, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Lithuania: Yellow represents the country’s wheat fields; green stands for forests; red symbolizes the patriotic spirit. Put together, they represent hope for the future, freedom from oppression and the fearless courage of the Lithuanian people.\\nHistory of the Flag of Lithuania\\nThe flag of Lithuania has three colors, in three horizontal stripes: yellow on top, green in the middle, and red on the bottom. This was the first flag of independent Lithuania, between 1919 and 1940, and once again in the early 1990s when the country left the Soviet Union.\\nThe colors represent the country’s nature: yellow represents the sun and the vast corn fields, and prosperity, green represents the forests and the meadows, and hope and freedom, and red represents the blood shed by Lithuanians fighting for independence and freedom.\\nThe historical origin of the current flag is uncertain, but it seems to have been an idea from exiled Lithuanians, who lived in Europe and the USA in the 19th century.\\nThe colors are frequent in embroidery patterns and traditional clothes, so it was a natural choice. Young Lithuanians especially are critical of this color choice, claiming they’re more representative of African countries than European ones.\\nFlag of Denmark\\nFlag of Denmark\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Denmark: Red represents the courage, boldness, and strength of the people to protect the Kingdom from foreign invasions. The white cross stands for Christianity and is common to the Nordic countries of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.\\nHistory of the Flag of Denmark\\nThe flag of Denmark is called Dannebrog in Danish, and it’s completely red with a white asymmetrical cross, the same style you’ll find throughout the Scandinavian flags.\\nAccording to a legend, the flag was sent by God to help the Danish on 15 June 1219 during the Battle of Lindanisa. Estonian pagans were winning, but when the divine flag came into the picture, the Danish warriors felt revived and won the battle.\\nAlthough the Danish kings have used the flag since the 14th century, it was most commonly used on ships until the early 1800s when it became the flag of the country. First, it was introduced in all military units in 1842. From then, its use was widespread and allowed to everyone.\\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, it’s the national flag that’s been in use for the longest, with the first reference in a document from 1370-1386.\\nFlag of Estonia\\nFlag of Estonia\\n3 colors: blue, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Estonia: Blue represents the clear blue skies and the large country’s coast, as well as the hope and aspirations of the people; black stands for the dark past of suffering of the people and the traditional black jacket worn by the peasants of the country; white represents the wish for unity, solidarity, enlightenment and the noble qualities of freedom and commitment to work.\\nHistory of the Flag of Estonia\\nThe flag of Estonia is simple with three horizontal stripes, light blue on top, black in the middle, and white in the bottom. It first appeared in the streets of Otepää in 1881, during the students’ movement known as Vironia.\\nIt was a national flag during the country’s first period of independence, from 1918 to 1940, and it became a national flag again after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reinstatement of Estonia’s independence.\\nAs with many other flags, the meaning of the colors of this national flag can be loosely interpreted. The blue might represent the sky, the lakes, and the sea so close to Estonia, or it could also mean honesty, while the black represents the tribulations of the Estonians and the traditional clothes worn by local farms. The white represents the snow covering the country for a large part of the year and the Estonians’ desire for national independence.\\nPoet Martin Lipp expressed an equally valid interpretation on his poem “The Estonian Flag,” which together with music composed by Enn Võrk became the non-official national anthem of Estonia. In that poem, the blue is associated with the sky, the black with the Estonians’ appreciation for their land and their dark fate, and the white with purity and hard work.\\nIn recent years and the beginning of Estonia as a nation, there have been mentions of adopting a new flag with the same colors but a Nordic style, with the same asymmetrical cross we see on the flags of Norway or Iceland.\\nFlag of Finland\\nFlag of Finland\\n2 colors: white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Finland: White represents the snow in Finland, also present in the summer; blue stands for the lakes and skies.\\nHistory of the Flag of Finland\\nThe flag of Finland is known by the Finnish as Siniristilippu which means the blue cross. As with all flags in the Nordic countries, this one is also inspired by the Danish flag. It has a white background with a blue cross, slightly thicker than the ones on other Scandinavian flags.\\nThe blue represents the water in the countless lakes in Finland and the white, which was already there in the first national flag, represents the snow that covers the country for many months.\\nThe current flag design might have its roots in the Russian Navy flag that inspired the St. Petersburg Yacht Club, which then inspired a Yacht Club in Helsinki called Nyländska Jaktklubben. Whatever the origin story, the national flag adopted in 1918, one year after the country’s independence, was the winner of a competition with four other applications. Artists Eero Snellman and Bruno Tuukkanen were the creators.\\nThe official state flag has the national coat of arms on the intersection of both lines of the cross.\\nFlag of Iceland\\nFlag of Iceland\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Iceland: All the colors of the flag of Iceland symbolize the nation’s geography. Blue stands for the Atlantic Ocean which surrounds the country; red represents the fires of the country’s volcanoes; white depicts the snow that covers a large part of Iceland.\\nHistory of the Flag of Iceland\\nThe flag of Iceland follows the same design as all other Scandinavian countries, with an asymmetrical cross laid over one single color. The background is blue and the cross is red with a white border separating the red from the blue.\\nThe colors represent Iceland’s nature: the blue represents the ocean, the red represents the volcanoes and lava fields, and the white represents the snow, glaciers, and geysers. The red might also represent the historical bonds with Denmark.\\nThis flag appeared in 1915 and began to be used in 1918 after Iceland became an autonomous territory at the end of World War I. The flag was only official in 1944 when the independence was legally recognized.\\nFlag of Ireland\\nFlag of Ireland\\n3 colors: green, white, orange.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ireland: Green symbolizes the native people of Ireland, the Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick, as well as the Society of United Irishmen, a Republican organization during the 1790s; orange represents the supporters of the House of Orange, the settlers in the seventeenth century; white between the other two colors depicts peace among the two sides, reflecting Irish independence and the union of the people of Ireland.\\nHistory of the Flag of Ireland\\nThe flag of Ireland has a typical three-color design, with three equally sized vertical stripes. The one on the right is green, the one in the middle is white, and the one on the left is orange.\\nThe meaning of each color is fascinating. The green represents Ireland’s old name, “the emerald isle,” and the country’s Catholic community. The white, effectively placed in the middle, represents the need to unite both religious communities in Ireland and live in peace. The orange represents the Protestant community, in the same color as the House of Orange-Nassau.\\nThis flag appeared in 1848, by the hand of the Young Irelanders, who challenged the English ruling over the island. A group of French women gifted the flag to their leader, Thomas Francis Meagher. It became more popular with the Irish nationalists when the Republic of Ireland became independent in 1916. It was approved in 1920 as the national flag of the new country.\\nFlag of Sweden\\nFlag of Sweden\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Sweden: Blue symbolizes truth, loyalty, and justice; yellow stands for generosity. The Swedish cross is probably a reference to king Eric the Holy, who saw the gold cross in the sky. Its appearance in the flag expresses the religious history of the nation and its early leaders.\\nHistory of the Flag of Sweden\\nFlag of the United Kingdom\\nFlag of the United Kingdom\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of the United Kingdom: Each of the crosses in the flag called the Union Jack to represent a country of the United Kingdom. The red horizontal and vertical lines are used in England’s flag to represent its patron Saint George’s cross. Ireland’s patron, Saint Patrick is represented in the red X stretching from corner to corner. Scotland is represented by the cross of Saint Andrew, a white X on a blue background. Wales shows up in the flag under England’s cross because it was part of the Kingdom of England.\\nHistory of the Flag of the United Kingdom\\nFlag of Norway\\nFlag of Norway\\n3 colors: red, white, blue.\\nMeaning of the flag of Norway: The red, white and blue colors may represent freedom like in the flags of France, the Netherlands, the USA, and the UK. The Scandinavian Cross is common to the other Nordic nations such as Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland. It symbolizes these nations’ shared history and Christianity.\\nHistory of the Flag of Norway\\nAs a Scandinavian country, Norway has a flag with a similar design of neighboring countries: an asymmetrical cross, closer to the left side, over a single color. The flag of Norway is red with a blue cross with a white border.\\nThe Danish flag called Dannebrog inspired this type of banners and the red of the Norwegian flag is a reference to the historical bonds between both countries. The color of the cross represents the cultural, historical, political, and geographical proximity to Sweden.\\nSome claim those colors that coincidently are the same as the famous French flag ones were chosen as a secret aspiration to independence, that only came at the beginning of the 20th century.\\nThe current flag of Norway was created in 1821 by Frederick Meltzer but was only officially adopted over half a century later, in 1898.\\nFlags of States not recognized, partially recognized or disputed\\nFlag of Transnistria\\nFlag of Transnistria\\n3 colors: red, green, gold.\\nMeaning of the flag of Transnistria / Pridnestrovia: The hammer and sickle represent peaceful labor and international proletarian unity.

Red was taken from the Saint George’s Cross; white is from the French royal emblem. The maple leaf symbolizes the national tree of Canada.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Canada\\nThe flag of Canada has three stripes, one white in the middle and two red on each side. There’s a leaf of a maple tree in the center, Canada’s national tree.\\nIt’s a relatively recent flag. It began in 1964 when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson decided it was time the country had a national flag (they used the United Kingdom flag until then) and created a committee to create one. Three flag proposals were discussed and the current version won the debate.  Dr. George Stanley created it in 1965, who, inspired by the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada, tried to fit all the country’s complexity into a simple concept.\\nThe leaf represents Canada’s native people, who for centuries had a close connection with maple and its syrup, still a traditional product in the country these days.\\nThe maple leaf had been used as a national symbol before by Olympic athletes and the Canadian military fighting in both World Wars.\\nThe colors, red and white, represent the historical relations with the United Kingdom since those are the colors of England.\\nThe flag was hoisted officially for the first time on 15 February 1965, a date the Canadians celebrate as Flag’s Day.\\nFlag of USA\\nFlag of the United States of America\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of USA: The colors of the flag, “The Stars and Stripes”, are the same as in the Great Seal of the USA. White signifies purity and innocence; red is for hardiness and valor; blue is the color of the Chief and means vigilance, perseverance, and justice. As for the stars, they symbolize the heavens and the divine goal to which man has aspired from time immemorial. There are 50 stars to represent the 50 states of the United States of America. The stripes, symbolizing rays of light coming from the sun, are 13 stripes, to represent the 13 British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of the United States of America\\nThe flag of the United States of America is perhaps one of the most famous in the world.\\nIt has 13 horizontal stripes that represent the territories that opposed England, and a blue square in the top left corner with 50 white five-point stars, one for each state.\\nThe number of stars has been adjusted over the years as the country grew. The most recent star was added in 1960 when Hawaii became a state official.\\nThe first historical reference to the flag dates back to 1777 and it was probably created by Congressman Francis Hopkinson, inspired by the flag of a group of activists, the Sons of Liberty, who organized a protest against the English customs.\\nAt that time, there were as many stars as there are stripes, 13, laid in a circle.\\nIt’s believed the choice of colors is purely aesthetical, without any specific meaning.\\nFlags of Central America\\nFlag of Belize\\nFlag of Belize\\n3 colors: red, blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Belize: The flag of Belize has twelve colors, more than any other national flag, but three are dominant. The colors represent the national parties of Belize, blue for the People’s United Party, red for the opposition party. Two woodcutters hold the shield with the coat of arms in a white circle in the center. One of the men carries an axe and the other a wooden oar. Behind them is a mahogany tree, very important to the economy of early Belize. The shield is divided into three sections containing tools for two important industries in Belize: woodcutting and boat-building. The banner has the national motto of the country “Sub Umbra Floreo”, which means “Under the Shade I Flourish”. Also present around all the images there is a chain of twenty-five leaves.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Belize\\nThe flag of Belize is mainly dark blue, with a considerably large national coat of arms in the center. There are two thin red stripes along with the flag, in the top and the bottom.\\nThere isn’t an official interpretation for the flag’s colors, but it might not be a coincidence that those are the same colors of the country’s two main political parties: People’s United Party (PUP) and United Democratic Party (Belize) (UDP).\\nThe flag was created around 1950, when the fight for independence started in Belize, ironically based in the colonial flag of that time. That original flag resembles the current one, except for the two red stripes that were added after the independence.\\nThe coat of arms shows two men, a mixed-race one and a black one, under a mahogany tree, one of them holding a paddle and the other one holding an ax. Under them, the motto in Latin “Sub umbra floreo,” which translates into “under the shade I flourish,” and that can be related to the growth of the sensation of a nation during the colonial times.\\nThe final version of the flag, as it has been used since the country’s independence in 1981, was chosen in a public competition. The winning flag had, initially, a red frame around the flag, later changed to the two stripes you see today in the flag of Belize.\\nFlag of Costa Rica\\nFlag of Costa Rica\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Costa Rica: The colors of the Costa Rica Flag are the same as in the French Tricolore. Blue symbolizes clear skies, the growth and development opportunities in Costa Rica, free and independent thinking, spirituality and perseverance; white represents joy and happiness, the power of wisdom, the initiative of the people and peace; red stands for the warmth and hospitality of the people, the blood of their sacrifices and the vibrancy of the land.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Costa Rica\\nThe flag of Costa Rica has consecutive horizontal stripes, with a broader red one in the center. One half of the flag mirrors the other one: dark blue and white on the top, then red in the middle and white and dark blue on the bottom.\\nThere’s another version, more elaborate and less used, that includes the national coat of arms laid over the red stripe on the left. The coat of arms consists of the country’s three volcanoes, framed by the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, where you can see small sailboats. The sun is represented by a seven-point star, one for each province in Costa Rica, rising above the volcanoes.\\nThe current flag is inspired by another one created in 1848, designed by Pacífica Fernandez, and adopted in 1906, with slight changes in 1964 and 1968.\\nFlag of El Salvador\\nFlag of El Salvador\\n2 colors: blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of El Salvador: Blue represents the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea; white stands for peace. The coat of arms on El Salvador’s flag is based on the coat of arms of the former United Provinces of Central America. It shows a triangle representing equality and the three branches of El Salvador’s government. Inside the triangle, there are five volcanoes symbolizing the five former members of the federation, flanked by the blue of the ocean and sea. The triangle contains symbols of liberty, ideals of the people and peace, represented by a red cap, golden rays, and the rainbow.

The issue was brought up for the first time in 1973, but in a referendum in 2016, the voters chose to keep the current design.\\nFlags of Micronesia Region\\nFlag of Micronesia\\nFlag of Micronesia\\n2 colors: blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Federated States of Micronesia: The color blue in the background stands for the Pacific ocean where the islands are located. The four white stars in the Micronesia flag represent four other islands which make up the Federation together: Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae and Yap.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Micronesia\\nThe Micronesia flag is light blue and has four white five-point stars placed as a triangle in the center.\\nThe symbolism of the flag is simple: the blue stands for the ocean where the archipelago is, and the four stars represent each one of the islands that make up the country – Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae.\\nThe original flag had six stars instead of four because the Marshall Islands and the Mariana Islands were part of the same political federation, but after those two archipelagos left the federation, the number of stars was adjusted.\\nThe flag was adopted in 1979 when Micronesia became independent.\\nFlag of Kiribati\\nFlag of Kiribati\\n4 colors: red, blue, white, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Kiribati: The frigate bird flying over the rising sun represents the equator and the blue and white wavy stripes represent the surrounding Pacific Ocean. The bird comes from the country’s coat of arms and represents strength, authority, freedom, and power at sea. The white stripes represent the three island groups: Gilbert, Line, and Phoenix; the 17 rays of the sun represent the 16 Gilbert Islands and Banaba (once Ocean Island).\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Kiribati\\nPerhaps not many people have heard of Kiribati, a small country in Oceania. It’s a tiny archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, between Australia and South America and it has one of the most original flags in the world. The flag has a red background, a wavy white and blue ocean over it covering the bottom half of the flag, a sun setting and a golden frigate bird flying over it.\\nThe 16 sunbeams represent the number of islands in the archipelago. The bird represents the connection with the ocean, power, and freedom. Waves, of course, symbolize the Pacific Ocean and the sun stands for the archipelago’s geographical location near the equator line.\\nThe flag was adopted right after the independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 when the islands’ name changed from the Gilbert Islands to Kiribati. Ironically, the coat of arms was designed by the British, specifically by Sir Arthur Gimble, who created it for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (as Kiribati and Tuvalu were known at the time).\\nFlag of Marshall Islands\\nFlag of Marshall Islands\\n3 colors: blue, orange, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Marshall Islands: The Marshall Islands’ flag represents the country’s geographical position. The stripes indicate that the islands are just north of the equator; the blue area places them in the central north-west Pacific Ocean; the off-center star to the left of the flag places the country slightly west of the international dateline. In more detail, blue symbolizes the Pacific Ocean; orange is a traditional color of the Marshall Islands which represents bravery and wealth; white stands for peace and brightness. The stripes are for the two main chains of the Marshall Islands, the Ralik chain (orange) and the Ratak chain (white). The expanding width of the stripes represents growth and vitality of the country. The star symbolizes each of the 24 municipalities of the Marshall Islands. The four longer points of the star are for the capital city of Majuro, the administrative districts of Kwajalein, Wotji, and Jaluit. These longer points form a cross to symbolize the Christian faith of the Marshall Islands.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Marshall Islands\\nThe Marshall Islands archipelago is located northwest of Australia in the middle of vast Pacific Ocean. Its flag has a dark blue background with two rays coming up from the bottom left corner, stretching out towards the opposite side of the flag.\\nThe top ray is orange, and the bottom ray is white. There’s a 24-point white star in the top left, with four of the points being larger than the rest (the ones indicating the four cardinal points).\\nThe 20 shorter star points, or rays, represent the provinces of the archipelago, while the four large ones represent the country’s four main cities: Majuro, Jaluit, Wotje, and Ebeye.\\nThe orange part of the flag represents the wealth of the islands and the white stands for hope. The predominant blue background represents the Pacific Ocean.\\nAs with many other flags, this one also stirs up different interpretations. Some texts claim the diagonal stripes represent the equator and the white and red symbolize the sunrise and the sunset, and others claim those are the colors of peace and courage.\\nThe flag was designed by Emlain Kabua, the wife of the first country’s ruler after independence from the USA in 1979.\\nFlag of Nauru\\nFlag of Nauru\\n3 colors: blue, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Nauru: Blue symbolizes the vast Pacific Ocean and the infinite sky; the twelve-pointed white star is for the twelve unique tribes of the country; the white star symbolizes the location of the nation in association with the Equator. The division into two equal halves recalls the history of the original populace of the nation who originated from two boulders.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Nauru\\nThe flag of Nauru is dark blue, with a thin yellow stripe across and a 12-point white star on the left of the lower half.\\nThe meaning of the star is peculiar. It doesn’t represent the number of regions or islands, unlike other flags in Oceania, but the number of indigenous tribes that used to live there despite two of them no longer exist.\\nThe yellow stripe represents the equator line, and the star is on the same location as the island in regards to that line, just one degree to the south.\\nThe blue stands for the ocean around Nauru, while the white of the star stands for phosphate, the small country’s biggest natural resource.\\nThe flag was chosen during a public competition and adopted on the country’s independence day, 31 January 1968.\\nFlag of Palau\\nFlag of Palau\\n2 colors: blue, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Palau: The light blue stands for the sovereignty and freedom achieved by Palau. Blue can also stand for the Pacific Ocean.The yellow full moon represents peace and the time for activities because the people of Palau consider the full moon to be sacred and ideal for plantation and harvesting.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Palau\\nThe flag of Palau is light blue with a yellow circle that appears to be in the center, but it’s actually placed slightly on the left.\\nThe blue represents the Pacific Ocean, and the yellow circle stands for the full moon, something that has a mythical significance to Palau’s locals. They believe that certain activities like fishing or harvesting have higher chances of success when done during a full moon.\\nThis flag, designed by John Blau Skebong, was adopted on 1 January 1981 when Palau became semi-independent under the protection of the USA.\\nFlags of Polynesia Region\\nFlag of Samoa\\n\\nFlag of Samoa\\n3 colors: red, blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Samoa: Red stands for courage; blue means freedom; white is for purity. The five stars are associated with the constellation of the Southern Cross identifying Samoa’s geographical position in the world map and its connection with New Zealand, which also has the Southern Cross on its national flag.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Samoa\\nThe flag of Samoa is mostly red, with a blue rectangle with five white five-point stars in the top left corner, which covers about 25% of the flag. As with many other flags in this part of the world, the stars represent the Southern Cross constellation, visible in Samoa’s night sky.\\nThe red stands for the bloodshed during the independence wars throughout the German occupation (1900-1914), although the country spent more time under New Zealand ruling (1914-1962).\\nThe flag first appeared in 1949, only with four stars at the time, but the final version appeared shortly after and became the flag of independent Samoa in 1962.\\nFlag of Tonga\\nFlag of Tonga\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Tonga: The Red Cross represents the arrival of Christianity to Tonga islands. The color red in the largest portion also has religious connotations, the blood of Christ and his sacrifice. The white quarter stands for purity.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Tonga\\nThe flag of small Tonga is one of the oldest flags in the continent, going back to 1863 and being part of the Kingdom’s Constitution since 1875 as unchangeable. It’s entirely red with a white square in the top left corner, with a red cross inside.\\nIt’s a religious flag where the red stands for the blood of Christ and the cross stand for Tonga’s residents’ faith. The white is a reference to purity.\\nThe flag was created by Taufa’ahau Tupou, a tribal leader who had been converted to Christianity shortly before he became King George Tupou I in 1849. There was the first flag, with a white background and two red crosses, that was replaced after in Tonga they found out the flag was too similar to the Red Cross one.\\nFlag of Tuvalu\\nFlag of Tuvalu\\n5 colors: azure, dark blue, red, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Tuvalu: The Tuvalu Flag has the Union Jack, the flag of the UK to represent the link maintained to date after a past dependency. The nine islands of the country are present in the nine stars.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Tuvalu\\nThe flag of Tuvalu is very similar to the flags of Australia and New Zealand: light blue background, with the Union Jack (the United Kingdom’s flag) covering ¼ of the flag in the top left corner. On the right half of the flag, there are nine yellow five-point stars.\\nThe blue stands for the Pacific Ocean, the stars represent the number of inhabited islands in the archipelago, and the Union Jack represents, of course, the connection of Tuvalu to the United Kingdom, from which it became independent in 1978.\\nBetween 1996 and 1997 the country used a flag without the Union Jack, which caused negative feedback from the population, who suspected the change of the flag meant the country would become a republic and replace the traditional monarchy. Because of those events, the flag was reinstated.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",
       " ['Table of Contents\\nMeaning of the Flags of South America\\nThe South American flags represent the national identity of each country. Each color has a meaning in the history of nations. Flags from South America vary on color and meaning. On this page, I list all flags of South America and their colors.\\nCopyright: I own the copyright usage of these images. You cannot use the text or image without permission.\\nSouth America National Flags\\nAlphabetic order\\nArgentina\\nBolivia\\nBrazil\\nChile\\nColombia\\nEcuador\\nGuyana\\nParaguay\\nPeru\\nSuriname\\nTrinidad and Tobago\\nUruguay\\nVenezuela\\nFlags of South America\\nFlag of Argentina\\nFlag of Argentina\\n3 colors: blue, white, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Argentina: The colors of Argentina’s flag probably represent the country’s connection with the House of Bourbon, not in power in Spain at the time of Argentina’s war of independence. Argentina may have wanted to show loyalty to Spain instead of France, who had taken control of Spain at the time. The symbolism of the colors blue, white and yellow may also be related to the sky and clouds with the sun shining. The sun portrayed is the symbol of the Incan god of Sun, Inti.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Argentina\\nArgentina’s national flag has some things in common with the flag from neighboring country Uruguay: the choice of the colors white and blue, and of the sun as a symbol.\\nIt has three horizontal stripes, two light blue in the top and bottom and a white stripe in the middle. The sun on the white stripe in the center is a reference to Inti, the Inca sun god.  \\nThe flag is probably a creation of legendary general Belgrano, an Argentinian military officer who opposed the connection between Spain and Argentina. Some say the general was inspired by the blue sky, while others claim he was influenced by the blue-colored uniforms of his soldiers to create the flag.\\nThe first version of the flag, without the sun symbol, first appeared in Rosario in February 1812 during Argentina’s Independence War. That first flag became the official national flag in 1816 but the current version as we know it would only appear in 1861.\\nFlag of Bolivia\\nFlag of Bolivia\\n3 colors: red, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Bolivia: Red represents the valor and courage of Bolivian soldiers; green symbolizes fecundity of the soil; yellow stands for Bolivia’s mineral resources and wealth.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Bolivia\\nThe Bolivian flag has three horizontal stripes: red in the top, yellow in the middle, and green in the bottom.\\nThe red stands for the bloodshed during the independence war and Bolivia’s fauna. Yellow stands for the country’s natural resources, and green is a symbol of the country’s soil fertility.\\nThe country gained independence in 1825 but the flag was slightly different then, although the color scheme is the same, indeed quite common colors for the indigenous Quechua and Aymara. It’s also believed there’s a connection to Simon Bolivar, the Latin American hero who fought for the region’s independence, and who used a blue, yellow, and red flag. Those colors have also influenced the flags of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.\\nThe current flag became official in 1851. The flag used to have the country’s coat of arms in the middle, and although it’s still part of the state flag, it has since been removed from the national flag.\\nFlag of Brazil\\nFlag of Brazil\\n4 colors: green, yellow, blue, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Brazil: Green represents the verdant pasture and forest region in Brazil; the yellow colored diamond shape indicates the country’s gold resources since Brazil once had the largest gold mines in the world. The blue circle represents the sky with twenty-seven white stars, each representing every “Federal District” and state of Brazil. The white banner contains the motto “Ordem e Progresso”, meaning “Order and Progress”.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Brazil\\nThe Brazilian flag, known in Portuguese as “A Auriverde” (in English, the gold and green one), is one of the most original flags in the world. It has a yellow diamond shape over a green background, a dark blue circle in the center with a narrow band around it that reads “Ordem e Progresso” (Order and Progress) and a group of stars laid asymmetrically. The flag was created by professor Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the help of Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis, and Décio Villares.\\nThe white stars are perhaps the most curious element in the flag. There are as many stars as there are states in Brazil, and they’re laid in a faithful depiction of what the sky looked like in Brazil on 15 November 1889, the date when Monarchy was abolished in the country. Four days later, the current flag was adopted as the country’s official flag, in replacement of a previous short-lived version that resembled the flag of the United States of America.\\nAugusto Comte’s positivism inspired the motto on the flag.\\nIronically, the green represents the House of Braganza of Brazil’s first king, Emperor Pedro I, and the yellow represents the House of Habsburg of his wife, Maria Leopoldina. The flag of republican Brazil was directly inspired by the imperial flag, with slight changes in the elements on the yellow diamond.\\nFlag of Chile\\nFlag of Chile\\n3 colors: blue, red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Chile: White stands for the snow-covered Andes mountain range; red symbolizes the blood spilled by the national heroes in the long fight for freedom in Chile; blue represents the clear blue skies of the country. The white star represents honor and pride.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Chile\\nThe Chile flag has two horizontal stripes, white in the top and red in the bottom, and a third vertical blue stripe in the left side. There’s a blue square covering about 1/8 of the flag’s surface, in the top left corner, with a five-point white star overlapped.  \\nThose are the same colors as the USA flag, and one has somewhat influenced the other. Chile’s flag is almost identical to the one in the state of Texas in 1839.\\nWhite represents the snow you’ll find in some parts of the country (in fact, Chile means snow in the local language), blue represents the sky, and red stands for the bloodshed by the patriots fighting for independence. The star is a symbol of the Chilean indigenous people and white stands for union and freedom. The star has one point for each region in the country.\\nThere were other flags considered as national flags before that, but the Chile flag was first seen in 1817 during the independence wars. The flag was officially hoisted for the first time on 12 February 1818, the day of the Declaration of Independence.\\nNo one knows exactly who created the flag, with many possible names being thrown around including Bernardo O’Higgins, José Ignacio Zenteno, Antonio Arcos e Gregorio and Andía y Varela.\\nFlag of Colombia\\nFlag of Colombia\\n3 colors: yellow, blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Colombia: Yellow stands for all the gold found in Colombia; blue stands for the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea but also represents the equality of all races and classes in Colombian society; red signifies the sacrifices of the martyrs and the blood shed by the heroes in the national independence struggle.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Colombia\\nThe Colombian flag has three horizontal stripes, a wider yellow stripe in the top, a blue in the middle, and a red in the bottom, both the same size.\\nThe yellow represents the Colombian gold, the blue stands for the ocean on the country’s coast, and the red symbolizes the bloodshed during the war for independence. There’s a second interpretation linking the yellow to national sovereignty, the blue to nobility, and the red to bravery.\\nFrancisco de Miranda created the flag, which then inspired the flags of Venezuela and Ecuador. Some documents show that Goethe was the source of inspiration for this flag. Goethe told Francisco de Miranda one evening: “Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colors are not distorted.” He continued to explain his vision of colors to the author of the flag, which resulted in the design we know today.\\nThe flag became official in November 1861.\\nFlag of Ecuador\\nFlag of Ecuador\\n3 colors: yellow, blue, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Ecuador: Yellow stands for the bright sunshine, gold and the fertility of the land in Ecuador; blue symbolizes the clear blue skies over the country and the ocean; red represents the patriotic spirit of the countrymen and the blood spilt in the long fight for freedom. The coat of arms of Ecuador shows a shield with the national bird of Ecuador, the condor, which means shelter and protection from foreign attack. The shield contains the image of the snow-capped peak of Mount Chimborazo, the highest in the country, and a steamboat on a river depicting the first ever steamboat in Latin America, which sailed on the Guayas River. The coat of arms as a whole symbolizes the dignity and pride of Ecuador.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Ecuador\\nThe Ecuador flag is very similar to the Colombian one. It has the same background and the same three horizontal stripes, with the wider yellow one followed by the blue and the red ones.\\nEcuador used to be part of a country that no longer exists and that included Colombia and Venezuela, called Gran Colombia. The current country inherited the flag from that former political union, with the same historical roots as the Colombian flag.\\nThe only difference is that the Ecuador flag has the national coat of arms in the center, which depicts an Andes condor looking out for the country’s safety.\\nThere’s an unofficial interpretation for the colors of the flag in Ecuador: Spain is the yellow and the blue in the middle represents the distance between Ecuador and the former colonial power.\\nFlag of Guyana\\nFlag of Guyana\\n5 colors: red, yellow, green, white, black.\\nMeaning of the flag of Guyana: Green stands for the forest and foliage of the country; yellow represents its extraordinary mineral resource and the bright future; red symbolizes the courage and vitality of the people; white represents the rivers; black signifies endurance. The flag of Guyana is also called The Golden Arrowhead’ because of its arrow shape.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Guyana\\nThe flag of Guyana has a green background with two overlaid triangles shaped like an arrow. The first one is wider, yellow, and has a white border. The smaller one is red with a black edge.\\nThe flag was officially used for the first time in 1966 and is a result of a public competition held in 1962. The winner was North-American Whitney Smith, and the flag is known in Guyana as “The Golden Arrowhead.”\\nThe green stands for the country’s lush landscapes, the yellow stands for the country’s mineral wealth, the red stands for the zeal and dynamic nature of Guyana, black stands for perseverance, and white is a symbol of the national rivers.\\nFlag of Paraguay\\nFlag of Paraguay\\n3 colors: blue, white, red.\\nMeaning of the flag of Paraguay: The flag of Paraguay is unique in the world because the front is different from the back. On the front of the flag, the national coat of arms is at the center of the white stripe. The coat of arms of Paraguay has a yellow star on a blue circle, framed by a palm branch and an olive branch, encircled by a red band with “Republica del Paraguay” across it. Centered on the back of the flag is the seal of the national treasury, depicting a golden lion and a staff topped with the Phrygian cap, a symbol of liberty. Above there is a curved red banner reading “Paz Y Justicia”, which means “peace and justice.”\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Paraguay\\nThe three-color Paraguay flag has three horizontal stripes: red in the top, white in the middle, and blue in the bottom. The national symbol is laid over the white stripe in the middle, a wreath of palm and olive tree branches around a five-point yellow star with the inscription “Republica del Paraguay” (Republic of Paraguay).\\nAnd now pay close attention to the uniqueness of this flag. On one side is what I described above, but on the reverse side of the flag is the seal of treasury: a lion under a red hat on a stick with the inscription “Paz Y Justicia” (peace and justice).\\nThe flag was officially adopted by Rodriguez de Francia, the president of Paraguay in 1842. As you can perhaps tell by the President’s name (Francia is France in Spanish), he was a French enthusiast, which explains why he chose this flag similar to the French one but with horizontal stripes.\\nThe current flag was revised in 2013 to change some details, so it matched its original design that has evolved slightly over the years.\\nFlag of Peru\\nFlag of Peru\\n2 colors: red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Peru: Red represents the blood spilled for achieving Peruvian independence; white symbolizes peace and purity.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Peru\\nThe Peruvian flag is easy to describe: three vertical stripes, one white in the middle and two red ones on each side. That simplified version is the one used more frequently, but there’s a more formal variation with the national coat of arms in the center.\\nThe first flag associated with Peru, when the country was still aspiring to be independent, appeared in 1820. It was the creation of general Guillermo Miller, and it was a completely blue flag with a sun in the center.\\nIn that same year, the first flag of the Republic of Peru appeared with the same red and white colors as of today but a different design. It was the creation of another military officer, general José de San Martin. In the following five years, the flag’s design evolved but kept the same color scheme, with two other versions until the current final one.\\nThere’s an interesting song in Peru called Marcha de Banderas (march of flags) that’s played during flag hoisting ceremonies. It’s a sort of a national anthem for that specific occasion.\\nThe red and the white are said to stand for the Incas and their influence in contemporary Peru.\\nFlag of Suriname\\nFlag of Suriname\\n4 colors: green, red, yellow, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Suriname: Green stands for the fertility and natural resources of the land and hope; white represents freedom and justice; red is for the country’s progress and struggles to achieve a better quality of life. These colors also represent three of Suriname’s political parties: red for the Hindu Vatan Hitkari; white for the People’s Party; green for the National Party. The yellow star represents a golden future for Suriname attained through unity and hard work. The five points symbolize the country’s five main ethnic groups, the Creoles (mixed African and Native American descent), Asian Indians, Chinese, American Indians, and Europeans.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Suriname\\nSuriname flag has three main horizontal stripes, split by smaller white ones. The central stripe is red, and the top and bottom ones are green. There’s a yellow five-point star laid over the central red stripe.\\nThe star stands for Suriname’s multi-ethnicity from continuous waves of immigration. The green stands for fertile soils and the country’s landscape, as well as for hope and future opportunities for Suriname. The white means justice and freedom and red means love, an unusual interpretation in world flags considering the color are typically associated with bloodshed during a war.\\nThe flag was adopted in 1975, after the country’s independence.\\nFlag of Trinidad and Tobago\\nFlag of Trinidad and Tobago\\n3 colors: red, black, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Trinidad and Tobago: Red represents the vitality of the land and its people; white is a symbol of the sea surrounding the country; black is for the industrious and hard-working nature of the people of Trinidad and Tobago.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Trinidad and Tobago\\nThe flag of Trinidad and Tobago is red with a diagonal black stripe with white borders, that add contrast to the red background.\\nRed means vitality and strength, black means union of the national population, and white stands for the citizen’s pure thoughts and the crests of the waves of the sea around the country. Other interpretations of the flag say that the red, black, and white stand for fire, earth, and water respectively.\\nThe flag was designed by Carlisle Chang, and chosen by the Independence Committee and adopted as the national flag in 1962, in the same year when the country became independent from the United Kingdom.\\nFlag of Uruguay\\nFlag of Uruguay\\n3 colors: blue, white, yellow.\\nMeaning of the flag of Uruguay: The colors blue and white of the Uruguay flag were inspired by the flag of Argentina. The sun emblem is the national symbol of Uruguay, representing the Inca sun god Into. It is called “Sun of May”, a symbol of freedom and independence since it refers to the May Revolution of 1810, in which Spanish American colonies started their revolt against Spain and finally gained independence. The nine stripes are a symbol of the nine provinces of Uruguay, which existed at the time the First Constitution of Uruguay was signed, in 1830.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Uruguay\\nThe flag of Uruguay has nine horizontal stripes, five white and four blue. There’s a white square with a yellow sun in the top left corner that covers about 1/8 of the flag’s total area. That symbol, called “The Sun of May,” has a human face and 16 sunbeams, eight wavy and eight straight. It represents the Inca sun-god Inti, just as in neighboring Argentina’s flag, and it stands for the events that took place in Buenos Aires during the May Revolution in 1810, that marked the beginning of the end of Spanish ruling.\\nThe nine stripes stand for each one of the country’s regions, as they were defined after Uruguay’s independence in 1828, following an armed conflict with Brazil. This flag’s design is influenced by the flags of the United States of America and Argentina, and Uruguayan politician Joaquín Suárez designed it.\\nFlag of Venezuela\\nFlag of Venezuela\\n4 colors: yellow, blue, red, white.\\nMeaning of the flag of Venezuela: The flag of Venezuela is based on another flag used by independence fighters who fought against Spanish colonial rule. At that time, yellow represented the gold of the Americas, blue symbolized the Atlantic Ocean which separated the new Americas from the bloody old world of Europe and Spain, which is represented by red. Today, the symbolic value of the colors is a bit different: yellow stands for new opportunities; red is for Spain; blue stands for the Atlantic Ocean. The eight stars in the flag represent the seven provinces that existed at the time of Venezuelan independence plus the province of Guayana, added in 2006.\\nCuriosities about the Flag of Venezuela\\nThe flag of Venezuela has a three-color design, with three equal horizontal stripes: yellow in the top, blue in the middle, and red in the bottom. In the center, laid over the blue stripe, there’s a circle with eight white five-point stars.\\nThose colors are a reminder of Gran Colombia, a political union that included Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Notice that, of those three countries, Venezuela is the only one with a flag with three same-sized stripes.\\nSeven of the eight stars represent the seven provinces that signed the document agreeing to the termination of Gran Colombia. The eighth star was added to the flag in 2006 during a reform led by then-president Hugo Chavez. It’s supposed to represent Esequiba, a region that’s part of Guyana but that Venezuela claims as part of their territory.\\nAlthough the current flag was approved only recently, it’s still based on the 1806 original design by Francisco de Miranda, adopted as the first flag of the country in 1811.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nGalapagos Last Minute Cruises Travel Information\\nGetting your Galapagos last-minute cruise is not difficult. I spent 16 days in the Galapagos Islands. When I decided to travel to Galapagos, I didn’t want to make any cruise. What I had in mind was to explore the several islands on my own, without getting any Galapagos cruise.\\nHowever, when I arrived in Puerto Ayora, the biggest city of Santa Cruz Island, I changed my mind. I decided to buy a last-minute Galapagos cruise.\\nWhy? Well, while visiting Puerto Ayora I was offered a very good last-minute deal to go on a cruise. Something I couldn’t refuse.\\nPuerto Ayora is the perfect city to get your Galapagos last minute deals because there are many tour operators and it’s actually the main headquarter offices for most cruise ships. So there is always up to date information about which boats have last-minute available places.\\nOn this page, I give you personal insights on how to get a cheap Galapagos cruise, detailed information about budget cruises and where to buy them, how to choose your itinerary, how much to pay, budget accommodation information and a few other tips and tricks.\\nGalapagos Last Minute Cruises – photo of South Plaza Island in the Galapagos Archipelago\\nLast Minute Cruises to the Galapagos\\nGetting to Galapagos by yourself is quite easy. You just need to get your airplane ticket online. My ticket from Guayaquil to Baltra and from Puerto Baquerizo Moreno to Guayaquil cost $337 USD. I bought my tickets 2 weeks in advance with LAN ECUADOR AIRLINE.\\nAirplane arriving at Baltra Island at Seymour Airport in the Galapagos\\nPresently all Galapagos cruises depart from Santa Cruz island. Not from San Cristóbal anymore.\\nPuerto Ayora Harbour in Santa Cruz Island Galapagos\\nBuying a last-minute cruise in Puerto Ayora is always much cheaper than in main land Ecuador or elsewhere in the world. In Puerto Ayora city center there are many offices that offer daily excursions, tours, and last-minute cruises information.\\nTravel Agency in Puerto Ayora Galapagos\\nOfficial Ecuadorian currency is the US dollar. Cash is king.\\nOfficial Ecuadorian currency is the US dollar\\nGive yourself a few days to wait for the perfect time to get a last-minute deal. This way you have more time and more cruises to choose from. You might wait a couple of days before the cruise starts. If you’re short on time, and the agency salesman becomes aware of that, your next day ticket will definitely be more expensive.\\nPuerto Ayora Fish Market with hungry pelicans and sea lions\\nCatamarans can be more expensive, yet faster in good weather conditions. Small yachts are less crowded and offer more personalized service. Big cruise ships should be avoided as you will not experience the real Galapagos.\\nCatamaran Galapagos Cruise\\nThere are some islands you can visit by yourself. Others you can only visit on a day trip tour package. Some islands you can only visit with a cruise.\\nSnorkeling in Santa Fe Island – Galapagos\\nChoose an itinerary far from the islands you can do by yourself.\\nLast-minute diving tours agency in Puerto Ayora Galapagos\\nChoose an itinerary that includes islands you would need to buy a day trip anyway. They cost from $80 to $160 USD per person. This way you save money. For example, a day trip to Bartolomé Island costs $180 USD, South Plaza Islands $80 USD and Santa Fé Island $90 USD. My point here is that a 4-day cruise can cost as low as $550 with accommodation and food included. A much better option.\\nGalapagos Tour sign in Puerto Ayora\\nNever rush to buy anything. Galapagos salesmen’s techniques are ferocious and you’ll be pushed to buy buy buy! Never buy without asking around. I asked for information in at least 4 different offices and realized that prices were different even for the same boat. One was actually twice more expensive than the others. One of the guys that were traveling on the same boat also got a last-minute ticket, but he paid doubled than me.\\nGalapagos Agency in Puerto Ayora\\nTechnically, there’s always one day less than what the agencies/websites sell. I mean, a 4-day cruise is technically a 3 day / 3 nights, a 5-day cruise is technically a 4 day / 4 nights, a 6-day cruise is technically a 5 day / 5 nights, … a 10-day cruise is technically a 9 day / 9 nights.\\nWhy? Because agencies count the last extra day taking you to visit the lava tunnels and the giant tortoise breeding center at the Charles Darwin Research Station in Santa Cruz Island as a cruise day. Which is not. So, basically, the last day will never be spent on board, rather a land tour as you have already done your check-out from the boat in the morning.\\nBoats Puerto Ayora Galapagos\\nGalapagos boat types: Luxury Class, First Class, Touristic Superior Class, Economy Class.\\nLuxury Class Galapagos Cruises\\nFirst Class Galapagos Cruises\\nTouristic Superior Galapagos Cruises\\nEconomy Class Galapagos Cruises\\nGalapagos boat sizes: small yachts take about 12-16 passengers, medium yachts take about 20-45 passengers and large cruise ships take about 90+ passengers.\\nYachts in Puerto Ayora harbor waiting to sail on a Galapagos cruise\\nTips are not included on the cruise price. A non-mandatory 10% of the cruise value is expected to be paid. Honestly, I do not agree with this since the boats already get a lot of money. You can pay or not. It’s up to you.\\nBuy sea sickness pills before going on board. You can get the pills at a pharmacy in Ecuador’s mainland or in Puerto Ayora in Santa Cruz Island. Sometimes the sea can get rough.\\nGalapagos Sea Sickness\\nAll Galapagos cruises have a mandatory official guide on board. They are very communicative and explain everything there is to know about Galapagos fauna and flora.\\nGalapagos Official Guide\\nYou can rent snorkeling and wet suits in Puerto Ayora, or pay a much more expensive snorkeling gear on board of the boat. You can also buy some $30 USD snorkeling equipment in one of the Puerto Ayora supermarkets.\\nSnorkeling in Galapagos\\nUseful to know before traveling\\nBefore the flight, at Quito or Guayaquil airport, you have to buy a $10 USD Immigration Control Card.\\n$10 USD Galapagos Immigration Control Card\\nBefore the flight, at Quito or Guayaquil airport, you’ll have to pass the Quarantine and Inspection control. Your luggage will be checked for fresh vegetables or fruits.\\nGalapagos Airport Quarantine Inspection\\nI preferred to fly into Baltra / Santa Cruz and fly out from San Cristóbal Island. This way I didn’t have to return to Santa Cruz after visiting San Cristóbal. I saved time and money with the taxi boat on a two insane hour trip between both islands.\\nFly to Baltra Island Seymour Airport in Galapagos\\nThe Galapagos National Park entrance fee costs $100 USD per person. $100 dollar bills sometimes are not accepted.\\nGalapagos National Park Price\\nThere are banks with ATM cash machines in Santa Cruz Island, Isabela Island and San Cristóbal Island.\\nATM cash machines in Puerto Ayora – Santa Cruz Island Galapagos\\nThere are supermarkets and groceries stores in: Santa Cruz Island, Isabela Island, Floreana Island and San Cristóbal Island.\\nA supermarket in Galapagos looks like this\\nThere are 2-hour taxi boats between Santa Cruz Island and Isabela Island, between Santa Cruz Island and Floreana Island and between Santa Cruz Island and San Cristóbal Island. The price is $25 USD or $30 USD if you bargain last minute.\\nGalapagos Islands transfers can be done by Boat Taxi\\nTicket of Fast Boat from Puerto Ayora to San Cristobal Island\\nIslands you can visit by yourself: Santa Cruz Island, Isabela Island, Floreana Island, and San Cristóbal Island.\\nUpper view of Isabela Island in Galapagos\\nIslands you can visit on a day trip tour: Bartolomé Island, South Plaza Islands and Santa Fé Island.\\nAgency in Puerto Ayora with Special Prices for Galapagos Daily Tours\\nIslands you can only visit on a cruise: Española Island, Genovesa Island, Fernandina Island, Marchena Island, Pinta Island and Wolf Island.\\nSea lions on the beach in Genovesa Island – you can only visit Genovesa while on a cruise\\nPrices vary. I paid $550 USD for a 4-day cruise on board of the first-class Estrella del Mar Yacht (all included except snorkeling gear and wet suit). Someone on my boat paid $1100 USD buying last minute in Puerto Ayora. Others on my boat paid $3000 USD booked back in Germany. An Italian guy I met at the border of Ecuador / Peru paid $600 USD for the same trip on the same boat. Other mid-range and low priced cruises are cheaper, yet the quality is also much lower. I advise you to get high-end yachts, luxury or first-class boats.\\nLast-minute 8 days from $1300 USD\\nI booked my last minute trip with Lonesome George Travel Agency and Tour Operator located in the center of Puerto Ayora town. I just showed up and start asking questions.\\nLast Minute Cruise Agency in Puerto Ayora – Lonesome George Travel Agency and Tour Operator\\nContacts: Lonesome George, Av. Baltra y Enrique Fuentes, Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island – Galapagos, Ecuador ● Phone: +593 5252 6245 ● Email: info@lonesomegeorge.com.ec ● Website: Lonesome George.\\nLast-Minute cruises departure prices outside an agency in Puerto Ayora\\nMany Galapagos animals can be seen without any cruise trip. Every island that can be visited all by yourself has sea lions, brown pelicans, and marine iguanas just there, sleeping in the middle of the sidewalk. You can see giant tortoises in ranches and in a few breeding centers. You can swim with sea lions, penguins, whitetip reef sharks and sea turtles for free. Many beautiful Galapagos endemic bird species will come next to you. Exotic birds such as Blue Footed Boobies, Frigatebirds, Greater Flamingos, and Great Blue Heron can be seen at very close range in many islands.\\nBlue-Footed Booby on a cliff in San Bartolome Island near Lobería Beach – Galapagos Wildlife\\nBudget hotels can be found in Santa Cruz Island, Isabela Island and San Cristóbal Island. A single room starts at $10 USD and a double starts at $20 USD.\\nCheap hostel in Isabela Island – $20 USD double room with TV, kitchen, WC\\nYou can eat at local restaurants cheaply around $4 USD per person – soup + main dish + juice.\\nBar Restaurant Kalé – $4 dollar menu in Puerto Ayora – Restaurants in Galapagos\\nThere are bicycles for rent in Puerto Ayora, Puerto Villamil and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. 1 Day $20, 1/2 Day $15 and 1 hour $4 USD.\\nBicycle rental in Galapagos\\n4-day Galapagos Cruise Deal\\nI bought a last-minute 4-day Galapagos cruise departing from Puerto Ayora. The trip itself was amazing and I’m happy I did spend some money to make this trip. I now write day-by-day detailed information about my trip.\\nDay 1 – Galapagos Islands Cruise\\nBaltra Island -> Bartolomé Island\\nSea Lions in Bartolome Island Galapagos\\nI started the day going from Puerto Ayora to Baltra Airport, where the official Galapagos guide was waiting to bring us on board the yacht.\\nEarly departure towards Bartolomé Island (Isla Bartolomé). This amazing island mix incredible rocky volcanic mountains with sand dunes. The most famous part of this island is the incredible Pinnacle Rock. After snorkeling with sea lions and Galapagos penguins, we went on hiking up the volcano hill.\\nDay 2 – Galapagos Islands Cruise\\nGenovesa Island\\nBaby Nazca Booby in Genovesa Island Galapagos\\nAfter a rough night-sea cruising, the boat finally anchors inside the horse-shoe shaped Darwin Bay, in Genovesa Island. Morning hiking to bird watching. This island is a great place to watch Darwin’s finches, Frigatebirds, Galápagos Mockingbirds, Nazca Boobies, Red-footed Boobies, Swallow-tailed Gulls, Storm petrels and Tropicbirds. After the hike, we went snorkeling with fur sea lions.\\nDay 3 – Galapagos Islands Cruise\\nSouth Plaza Island -> Santa Fé Island\\nYellow Land Iguana in South Plaza Island Galapagos\\nLong night cruising. Arrival at South Plaza Island in the morning where we went on a couple of hours walking to see Red-billed Tropicbirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and a large colony of Galapagos Land Iguanas.\\nAfter South Plaza, we cruised to Santa Fé Island. This is a great place for snorkeling and hiking the hill top among the palo santo trees and cactus. Santa Fé is the habitat of one endemic species, the Barrington land iguana. Sea lions can be seen all over the beach at Barrington Bay. Snorkeling is amazing, and you can swim with marine iguanas, sea lions, and whitetip reef sharks.\\nDay 4 – Galapagos Islands Cruise\\nSanta Cruz Island\\nGiant Tortoise Turtle in Santa Cruz Island Galapagos\\nAfter sleeping the last night onboard the boat, we are taken early in the morning to Puerto Ayora. Inside a tour bus, we visit the Santa Cruz Lava Tunnels, the Tortoise Farm Rancho Primicias, and the Charles Darwin Research Station.

       " ['Lake Tana, Stone Castles and Holy Wars – Ethiopia\\nAll along the 16th and 17th centuries, the ancient region of Abyssinia was struggling to maintain its millennial-year old cultural values, protecting its religion and language against Islam. This was a time of ferocious Holy Wars.\\nOn the shores of Lake Tana – Ethiopia, there are still the remains of a small village, dating from the early 1600s, that totally changed the country’s architecture style. Throughout history, Ethiopia has always been a leading Christian territory.\\nIn 1487, D. João II – the Portuguese King, sent Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva to Ethiopia to investigate the location of that mythical kingdom, in an attempt to make it a possible ally on a subsequent expedition to India.\\nPêro da Covilhã stayed there and eventually integrated himself within the community, mixing with the locals. Documents are proving that, around the year 1543, there was a small Luso-Ethiopian community in the region. As a result of the aggressive invasions of the Ottoman Empire, Empress Mother Eleni sought to get help from Portugal and asked for assistance.\\nEthiopian Family in Gorgora Nova\\nBy this, the Portuguese were partly responsible for the independence of Ethiopia, with extensive fighting campaigns against the Muslims. Portuguese military campaigns made it possible to preserve Christianity in the oldest Christian country in the world – Ethiopia.\\nThe Portuguese army presence in the region supported the Ethiopians against Muslims, who had conquered neighboring Eritrea in 1557. Leaving behind the usual century-old campgrounds, the Ethiopian monarchs started to build castles, similar to the Portuguese ones: made of stone, with two or three floors, and of square design.\\nThe most notable examples of the influence of Indo-Portuguese architecture in Northern Ethiopia architecture are the castles and palaces of the medieval historical city of Gondar. These Gondar monuments include Fasilides’ Castle, the adjacent palaces, and Fasilides’ Bath.\\nVisit Gorgora Nova ruins in Ethiopia\\n17th century Portuguese Jesuit church of Nova Gorgora in Lake Tana, Ethiopia\\nRead my page: Historical Places to Visit in Ethiopia\\nGorgora Nova\\nRuins of Gorgora Nova Cathedral in Ethiopia\\n17th century Portuguese Jesuit settlement\\nGorgora Nova ruins\\nThe Jesuit missionaries settled about 7 miles / 11 km southwest of Gorgora town – at 5905 feet / 1800 meters high. They called this new outpost Gorgora Nova. Under the supervision of Pêro Pais, an impressive baroque style Catholic church, a Royal Palace, and some Jesuit residences were built within a small stone village.\\nGorgora Nova represents the beginning of stone construction around Lake Tana and in Ethiopia. The missionary Pêro Pais succeeded in converting the Emperor to Catholicism, but his son – Emperor Fasilides, quickly sent the Portuguese out – returning to Orthodox Christianity.\\nWhatever remains of the old Jesuit settlement was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake a few decades ago. There is a project, from the Ethiopian and the Portuguese Government, to rebuild and fix the whole complex with funds from UNESCO, but when, we do not know.\\nI’m positively sure that this will not last much longer. Will they come on time before this important part of history disappears?\\nIn the northern region of Gondar – Dembya district, there are other interesting historical sites: the Man Indeaba Monastery, the Stele of Mosoloni, the Monastery of Debresina Maryam, and the ruins of Emperor Susenyos’s palace.\\nHow to get there\\nVideo in how to get to Gorgora Nova\\nWith great effort, I decided to go there – to reach this supposedly hard destination. To get to Gorgora Nova, aka Mariame Gemb, was not easy, as there is no local direct transport. I took the bus from Gondar until a small village 11 miles / 17 km away from Gorgora.\\nAt that time, there was no longer local transport heading to Lake Tana, so I had to walk until reaching Gorgora just before sunset. The next morning I had to go on off-road driving, 7 miles / 11 km to the old Portuguese settlement, which is now protected by an armed guard.\\nWalk 17km to Gorgora in Lake Tana\\n11 km 4WD transportat along Lake Tana\\nStaying for two nights in Lake Tana was one of my best experiences in Ethiopia. A fantastic location with hippos, monkeys and many exotic birds. The sunrise was one of the nicest I’ve ever seen in my life. I slept at Tim & Kim Village, a very nice hotel in Gorgora.\\nAfter a long walk, I finally reached Gorgora Nova, where I was welcomed by the site’s guardian and his family. This Ethiopian family lives just aside from the old ruins and maintains the place safe and protected. The strategic position of the ruins makes us understand why this was built there. You can see the whole lakeshore. Breathtaking.\\nSunset in Lake Tana\\nFisherman in Lake Tana\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

There is a project, from the Ethiopian and the Portuguese Government, to rebuild and fix the whole complex with funds from UNESCO, but when, we do not know.\\nI’m positively sure that this will not last much longer. Will they come on time before this important part of history disappears?\\nIn the northern region of Gondar – Dembya district, there are other interesting historical sites: the Man Indeaba Monastery, the Stele of Mosoloni, the Monastery of Debresina Maryam, and the ruins of Emperor Susenyos’s palace.\\nHow to get there\\nVideo in how to get to Gorgora Nova\\nWith great effort, I decided to go there – to reach this supposedly hard destination. To get to Gorgora Nova, aka Mariame Gemb, was not easy, as there is no local direct transport. I took the bus from Gondar until a small village 11 miles / 17 km away from Gorgora.\\nAt that time, there was no longer local transport heading to Lake Tana, so I had to walk until reaching Gorgora just before sunset. The next morning I had to go on off-road driving, 7 miles / 11 km to the old Portuguese settlement, which is now protected by an armed guard.\\nWalk 17km to Gorgora in Lake Tana\\n11 km 4WD transportat along Lake Tana\\nStaying for two nights in Lake Tana was one of my best experiences in Ethiopia. A fantastic location with hippos, monkeys and many exotic birds. The sunrise was one of the nicest I’ve ever seen in my life. I slept at Tim & Kim Village, a very nice hotel in Gorgora.\\nAfter a long walk, I finally reached Gorgora Nova, where I was welcomed by the site’s guardian and his family. This Ethiopian family lives just aside from the old ruins and maintains the place safe and protected. The strategic position of the ruins makes us understand why this was built there. You can see the whole lakeshore. Breathtaking.\\nSunset in Lake Tana\\nFisherman in Lake Tana\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

       " ['Table of Contents\\nHistorical Trips Around the World\\nHistorical Trips Around the World\\nCountless people and groups attempted to travel around the world throughout History. It would be impossible for me to list all of them on an article like this one. But let’s select the most significant ones, starting with the second round-the-world trip, that followed the stunt of Ferdinand Magellan and his crew.\\nFrancis Drake managed to captain a round-the-world trip from beginning to end aboard the Golden Hind. With the support of Queen Elizabeth, it sailed off in 1577 planning to sail around South America and attack the Spanish colonies on the west coast of that continent. The fleet had five small ships, but it managed to seize a Spanish galleon full of treasures. Francis Drake reached Plymouth on 26 September 1580, to where the queen herself traveled to knight him.\\nIn the same year Drake completed his journey, Franciscan Ignacio de Loyola was sailing from Cadiz on a round-the-world trip. Imagine how adventurous a trip like this was at the time, how long it took, and how risky it was. But none of that dissuaded the Franciscan priest. He visited the Philippines and reached China where he was sentenced as a spy and arrested. He was a prisoner for one year but was later released and sent to Macau. He wandered through Japan before starting his journey back to Europe, where he reached in 1584.\\nBut this wouldn’t be the end of it for Loyola. He left again the next year, on a round-the-world trip but in the opposite direction, becoming the first person ever to make this trip twice, and in different directions.\\nIn the 17th century, there are records of nine round-the-world trips, five of them starting in Holland. Of those, I would like to highlight the one made by Francesco Carletti (between 1594 and 1602), the first one where someone was just a passenger, and the one made by Pedro Cubero (from 1670 to 1679) that included traveling by land.\\nIn the next century, there are records of 14 sea trips around the world. William Dampier became the first person to complete three round-the-world trips. Jeanne Baré, disguised as a man, infiltrated the expedition led by Louis de Bougainville and became the first woman to travel around the world, between 1766 and 1799. And between 1787 and 1790, Robert Gray commands the first expedition sailing off North America.\\nIn the 19th century, there were 19 sea trips around the world. It was a time of national firsts, with the following countries sending out ships on this kind of expedition: Russia, Argentina, United States, Denmark, Peru, and Austria (at the time the Austro-Hungarian empire had access to the sea). Between 1831 and 1836, the HMS Beagle traveled around the world, under the command of Captain Fitzroy and with a remarkable passenger on board: Charles Darwin. This expedition would have a crucial role in the scientific career of this young naturalist, that kept a travel journal later published as The Voyage of the Beagle.\\nIn 1881, King Kalakaua of Hawaii became the first king to conclude a round-the-world trip. Three years later, Thomas Steven traveled around the world by bicycle, although he relied on ships for some parts of the way. In 1889, Nellie Bly brought Jules Verne’s novel Around the World in 80 Days to life. Better yet, she did it in just 72 days in steamships and trains, establishing a new record.\\nIn the 20th century, individual trips lost part of their historical meaning. They became too easy, especially after World War II and the increasing number of commercial air routes. Even so, some journeys were remarkable for being the first.\\nIt was the case of German Clärenore Stinnes and Swedish Carl-Axel Söderström who became the first people to drive around the planet. In the mid-1920s with the existing technology and lack of technical assistance that would be a much harder task than it is today.\\nIt was a simple Adler Standard 6 car, without any special adjustment or preparation for the trip they were about to embark on. The travelers were sponsored by Adler, Bosch, and Aral and took a second car for support packed with spare parts and gear, driven by two mechanics.\\nThe trip began in Germany, then through the Balkans until they reached Syria. Then they traveled through what is known today as Iraq and Iran and then headed to Moscow. The two mechanics abandoned the expedition at the Russian capital, and the adventurous couple continued to travel alone through the heart of Siberia, driving by Lake Baikal, and crossing the Gobi Desert. They reached Beijing and from there boarded on a ship with their car towards Japan.\\nThey crossed the Pacific, with a stop in Hawaii, and reached South America. They drove by Lima, crossed the Andes and reached Buenos Aires, going up North towards Central America. They did the USA road trip from South to North, visiting Vancouver and then traveling to the opposite coast. They were welcomed by US President Herbert Hoover and in New York boarded a ship to Europe. They reached Le Havre from where they drove to Berlin, where they arrived on 24 June 1929. They traveled 47,000 km.\\nJust like in the movies, after they returned Carl-Axel Söderström got divorced and married Clärenore. They both lived in Sweden, where they had three kids and died of old age (him at 82, her at 96).\\nIn 1980, Canadian Rick Hansen who was a wheelchair user after a car accident decided to go on a trip around the world. He was inspired by the story of his fellow countryman Terry Fox who had an amputee leg due to bone cancer and started the Marathon of Hope, running from Newfoundland to Vancouver. Fox never made it because the cancer spread, but he inspired Hanses to embark on an even bigger adventure.\\nHe started his Man in Motion World Tour on 21 March 1985, departing from Vancouver. His start was low key but as he progressed he began attracting media coverage. Hansen’s trip covered 34 countries in 26 months. When he entered the BC Place Stadium on 22 May 1987, he had traveled for 40,000 Km and was welcomed by a frenzied crowd.\\nHis adventure inspired the movie Heart of Dragon (2008) and the song St. Elmo’s Fire (Man in Motion) that became a hit with the movie St. Elmo’s Fire (1985), written in his honor by John Parr.\\nEnglish Robert Garside became the first person to run around the world. After two failed attempts, he departed from New Delhi in India on his third and successful try. Robert left on 20 October 1997 and ran through Tibet and China, where he was arrested for a while due to issues with his documents.\\nHe then flew to Japan, where he ran across, before taking another flight to Australia where he added a considerable number of kilometers to his running shoes. From there, he flew to the south of Chile where he begins a slow cross of all the American continent that he completes with the help of two flights.\\nHe takes a flight from New York to South Africa, where he planned to run across the continent. This was at the time of the 9/11 attacks, so he decides to catch a plane to Morocco. He runs through Europe, from the South, until he reaches Turkey. He takes another flight to Egypt in an attempt to cross Africa again but doesn’t succeed. He then flies to Mozambique where he symbolically runs for a little. He leaves to India for the final leg of the trip where he reaches 13 June 2003.\\nYou can check out all the details of the trip, as well as photos and notes by Robert Garside.\\nDumitru Dan: the first trip around the world on foot\\nDumitru Dan\\nBetween 1910 and 1923, Romanian professor Dumitru Dan went in the first trip around the world on foot. Of course, he had to cross two oceans, but he continued to walk back and forth even when he was on board the ships. The trip was sponsored by Touring Clube de France who would award 100,000 French francs to whoever took the trip. At the time, Dumitru and his three fellow countrymen Paul Pârvu, George Negreanu, and Alexandru Pascu were young College students and took on the challenge.\\nThey returned to Romania to gather information and resources and start training. They learned how to play the flute and dance traditional Romanian folk dances. They left in 1910 with their dog Harap. The next year, when traveling through Mumbai the Raja invited them to a feast. After the meal, three of them left to look for food for the next leg of the trip, but Alexandru Pascu stayed. That was the last time they would see him alive. He died of an opium overdose.\\nGeorge Negreanu died two years later when the three friends were crossing a mountainous region in China. He was leading the way but didn’t see a crack in the middle of the trail, and he fell. His friends rescued him and took him to the hospital but he died before a doctor could see him. Lastly, Paul Pârvu didn’t resist the trip. Years of walking nonstop led to gangrene that eventually led to amputating both legs. They were in Jacksonville, Florida at the time. Paul Pârvu stayed behind with the dog, but he passed away in May 1915.\\nOnly Dumitru finished. He had to put the journey on hold in 1916 because of World War I, but he would complete the challenge in 1923. Tragically, inflation took a big chunk off the award money. If we compare it to our current time, the initial award was around 500,000 Euros, but it shrunk to 40,000 by the time Dumitru got the money.\\nAccording to his records, he crossed five continents, 76 countries, and 1,500 cities, wearing out 497 pairs of shoes.\\nDumitru Dan was the first of a list of 12 people who walked around the world.\\nIn our current century, there are records of the most bizarre trips:\\nMike Golding did two consecutive round-the-world trips in 2001, one in each direction. Between 2010 and 2012, Planet Solar became the first solar-powered ship to travel around the world.\\nBetween 2011 and 2012, Laura Dekker sailed around the planet alone. She was 14 when she started her trip.\\nBetween 2008 and 2011, Japanese Minoru Saito did the same thing as Dekker, except he became the oldest person to achieve it at age 77.\\nThe Transglobe Expedition\\nTransglobe Expedition\\nOf all the trips around the world, this one was special: it was the first one, and perhaps the only one, that happened from North to South, crossing both poles. And without traveling by air!\\nThe journey started in 1979 when British adventurers Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton left Greenwich towards the South Pole.\\nRanulph Fiennes, a former military at the British SAS, had started to plan the trip in 1972 inspired by his wife Ginny, collecting all the sponsors he needed for the trip.\\nThe travel’s original goal was to travel around the Earth from North to South, so most of the crossing was aboard Benjamin Bowring, a ship prepared for the polar nature. It’s a 65 meters long ship, built in 1952, and used on the set of Hell Below Zero, a 1954 film inspired by the book The White South.\\nThey started the trip in the most straightforward way: crossing Europe, by driving across France and Spain, then crossing Africa, across the Sahara desert, and boarding the ship in Abidjan. Next stop would be South Africa.\\nOn 22 December Bennie Bee, as the ship was known by the crew, sailed away to Antarctica. They reached the South-African base SANAE II on 4 January, unloading all the gear the team would need to face crossing the ice continent. Despite the reduced number of crew members, they had 200 tons of cargo, that they had to carry on snowmobiles to the first base at 72 55’S 3 29’W, about 290 km from the coast.\\nThey built four flimsy cardboard shelters, with just a thin layer of insulation. They would have to do against the severe polar winter. One tent was for accommodation, one for the generator, one for the radio, and one for the VLF (Very Low Frequency) equipment.\\nWhen winter came, the shelters were immediately covered in ice, and they dug tunnels to store gear and supplies and to travel between shelters.\\nThe season went by with a series of minor incidents: small fires, frost bites, carbon monoxide poisoning, personal conflicts caused by continued coexistence in a small space. And then in July, the generator was broken beyond repair.\\nOn 5 August the sun returned which urged them to get everything ready to cross the continent by only three people: Ranulph, Oliver, and Charles.\\nThey left on 29 October with Ollie, that would keep them company until the pole, each on a snowmobile pulling a sleigh carrying 700 kg of cargo. They reached the South Pole station on 14 December, three weeks ahead of schedule. They stayed there the 23, with air support responsible for their supplies. Crossing the Antarctic ended on 11 January.\\nThey stayed for a couple of weeks at Scott Base. Bennie Bee arrived on 20 January, but they only left to New Zealand in mid-February. The crew organized events and presentations in Auckland and then in Sydney, Australia before they sailed to Los Angeles.\\nThey stopped in Vancouver before tackling the Arctic. From there, the ship sailed to the mouth of the Yukon River in Alaska.\\nCrossing the North Pole seemed simpler, but too many things went wrong. At his wife’s request, Oliver abandoned the expedition. The crew that had crossed the South Pole was now down to two members. Later they found out the ice formation was more extensive than expected that year, blocking their passage and making them go on a detour around Devon Island.\\nThey reached the Tanqueray Fjord on 31 August, beginning a slow walk until Alert Base, where they arrived almost one month later. They spent the Winter there waiting for five months before they could cross the North Pole. They left the comfort of the base on 12 February on two snowmobiles. But it was slow progress. A series of decisions to try to get back the lost time followed. They switched to sleighs that converted into canoes, handed to them by the air support team. Then Bombardier sent them new snowmobiles, but they were too light and couldn’t pull the sleighs. The crew had to bring back the previous snowmobiles. They began to pick up the pace until Ranulph, and his sleigh fell into the ice water.\\nThere was a series of problems and incidents. If in the beginning it was too cold and icy to move forward, now there were holes on the ground that prevented the two men from going further.\\nThey finally reached the pole in April and took on the rest of the crossing from there. As the ice quickly melted around them, they found themselves stuck on a block of ice which turned out to be their unexpected transportation. They drifted for more than three months before Bennie Bee could rescue them. The reunion happened on 4 August, coordinates 80 31’N 0 59’W. The first round-the-world trip from North to South was complete, with one last trip to London where they reached on 29 August 1982.\\nCheck the complete stories and photographs of the Transglobe Expedition and on Ranulph Fiennes’ official website.\\nThe Journeys of Mike Horn\\nIn 1999, Mike Horn started a round-the-world trip at the equator, but this was not the only thing that set his trip apart. In addition to following the most challenging route, facing the weather and the difficulties posed by nature at latitude zero, Mike did it on his own and his own transportation, without flights nor public transportation.\\nMike Horn, a South-African living in Switzerland, sailed from the west coast of Africa to Brazil. He crossed that vast country on foot, on a bicycle, and a canoe, passing the unsurpassable Amazon and then the Andes until reaching the Equator, the country.\\nNext, he crossed the Pacific across the bigger islands in Indonesia, tackling the jungle in Borneo and Sumatra, until he boarded his reliable 8-meter long trimaran again. On the other side of the Indian Ocean, he reached the east coast of Africa, where he faced the last but not most simple leg of his adventure: crossing the black continent from coast to coast. He did it alone and on foot!\\nHe reached his starting point 18 months later. He had completed his Latitude Zero Expedition which granted him a meeting in Rome with Pope John Paull II.\\nIf this first round the world trip is not enough to add Mike Horn to the list of greatest explorers in our planet, his second large project will. He’s doing a second round the world trip from North to South, something only the British team Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton have done so far. Except Mike will raise the bar by taking the trip or at least crossing the polar continents alone.\\nAt the time I’m writing this article, Mike is halfway through this great adventure, that you can follow on his official website or Twitter, and he’ll use a Class G car for the overland parts of his trip. Mike sailed from Monaco Yacht Club aboard his sailboat Pangaea toward Namibia. From there he crossed the desert to his birth country South Africa, where he boarded Pangaea again and sailed to the coast of Antarctica.\\nFrom now on, only the future will tell us what will happen, but the plan is to ski across the frozen continent, sail to New Zealand and Australia, explore Papua New Guinea on land, cross towards Asia and then immerse himself in the vastness of Siberia. At Kamchatka, he’ll board once more his sailboat to reach the Arctic. He’ll ski across that continent and then across Greenland, the world’s largest island. Once that is done, he’ll sail back on Pangaea to Monaco, his starting point.\\nIf you don’t think project Pole2Pole is that demanding, you’ll change your mind after finding out that Mike Horn, the man who wants to ski across two polar continents, is 50 years old. What will he feel at the end of this adventure, when he becomes the only person to have done two round the world trips, one from North to South and one from East to West?\\nAround the World in Literature\\nThe first literary reference to a round-the-world trip was written by Greek traveler Pausanias who lived around year 100, translated into French in 1797. Of course, the world according to Pausanias wouldn’t be the same as we know today. He meant the world of the classic age, which was limited to part of Europe, the Mediterranean basin, and the near East.\\nIn 1699, Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri wrote Voyage du Tour du Monde, published in France a few years later. That was probably the first written record of a round-the-world trip for fun and using only public transportation. The Italian wrote fascinating stories about the world in the 17th century, including the exotic Persia, the territories under the ruling of the Ottoman Empire, and the faraway Hindustan and China.\\nThe trips around the world become popular in the mid 19th century thanks to the improvement of transportation that meant that the (almost) everyday man and woman could embark on such adventures.\\nIn 1853, Jean Arago published Voyage autour du Monde. In 1871, the Union Pacific Railroad Company published Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway and, that same year, Edmund Planchut publishes Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days. Between 1870 and 1871, North-American William Perry Fogg travels around the world, writing his experiences and impressions on a series of letters published in the Cleveland Leader newspaper that later became a book published in 1872, Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt.\\nThe year 1872 was a decisive one in the History of around the world traveling. Thomas Cook organized the first tour of this kind, that took seven months and was documented in a series of letters that were made public the next year, Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World. More importantly, in 1872 Jules Verne published the book that would become the most famous and inspiring work for generations of travelers: Around the World in 80 Days.\\nPhileas Fogg and the Most Famous Round the World Trip\\nPhileas Fogg and the Most Famous Round the World Trip\\nJules Verne, the famous French writer who had already published “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” “In Search of the Castaways,” and “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,” gave the world one of its most acclaimed masterpieces: “Around the World in 80 Days”.\\nJules Verne’s books filled the imagination of generations, inspiring countless books and movies, and inspiring the work of science fiction writers.\\nSometimes it’s hard to believe that Jules Verne wrote that book in the mid 19th century when you think about how current the events and technology seem. That is, of course, a characteristic of science fiction books but let’s face it, the idea of traveling around the world at that time was as crazy as the adventures of the Nautilus submarine in the deep ocean (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea).\\nBut let’s keep things in perspective: at the time the book “Around the World in 80 Days” was published, the golden age of geography and world exploration had just begun. It would be another 15 years until the two officers of the Portuguese Navy, Roberto Ivens and Hermenegildo Capelo, crossed Africa from Angola to the opposite coast. If crossing a relatively narrow continent was considered a feat at the time, can you imagine traveling around the world in 80 days?\\nThat’s what the friends of Phileas Fogg, the book’s main character, thought too. But let’s start at the beginning: the story begins in London, where our friend lives. His past is not revealed, but we know he’s wealthy, living well, and a regular customer at the Reform Club (a historic gentleman’s club in London). This is the place where a friendly argument starts after reading an article on the Daily Telegraph. According to the British newspaper, a new railway in India will make it possible to travel around the world in just 80 days. A piece of news to which Fogg’s friends react with a firm “impossible!”\\nBut Fogg believes it can be done. A debate ensues and ends with a bet: the club members will give Phileas Fogg 20,000 Pounds (something like 2 million Euros today) if he departures the next day and returns to meet them 80 days later. It’s the first day of October so our friend must catch the train out of London the next day and return on 21 December.\\nItinerary of Around the World in 80 Days\\nAROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS\\nPages full of travel adventures follow. The route of Fogg and his French servant Jean Passepartout takes them through Europe until the Italian city of Brindisi, on the heel of that country’s boot-shaped map, where they board a steamship to cross the Suez Canal (a 7-day trip) towards Mumbai (another 13 days).\\nOnce in India, they travel by train to Calcutta (3 days) where they take a steamship to the south seas of China, getting off in Hong Kong (13 days). From there they take another ship to Yokohama in Japan (6 days). The most extended leg of the trip, across the Pacific Ocean, is of course done on another steamship to San Francisco. From the US West Coast to the East Coast, they take a train to New York (7 days). The adventure is almost complete. All they need is to cross the Atlantic Ocean to Liverpool (8 days). If you did the math, you’d notice that 79 days went by. Will Fogg and his loyal servant Passepartout reach the Reform Club in time to win the bet?\\nI can’t answer that question without spoiling the book, and it wouldn’t be fair to those who haven’t read the story yet.\\nLet’s talk a bit about the background of this book, Jules Verne’s most famous work at least in English. He wrote “Around the World in 80 Days” during the Prussian Franco War (1870-1871), at a time he was serving on the French Coast Guard. Shrewd, he realized the importance of three critical events in World History: the Suez Canal (1869), the railroad connecting San Francisco to New York (1869), and the railroad that crossed the Indian sub-continent (1870), which caused the bet to take place in the book.\\nFor more than a century, and despite its success, Verne’s book was not taken seriously. There were no studies about “Around the World in 80 Days” until 2006. It wasn’t until the 21st century that we had good quality translations and essays and studies about this book by Verne.\\nAround the World on Television\\nAlthough there were several television shows produced around the name and the theme of trips around the world, most of them just rode the wave and had separate episodes produced in different parts of the world, without any logical sequence.\\nThat is the case with Around the World, by Arthur von Wiesenberg, that despite the name it’s just a popular travel talk show, or Rev Runs Around the World produced by the Travel Channel. Famous Rev Runs travels around the world with his wife Justine and his children Russy and Miley with roundtrip plane tickets. Each episode documents the place they’re visiting and not the actual trip between locations. The sequence of episodes is random, without a natural route in mind.\\nThere is, however, a television show produced by the BBC in 1989 focusing on the adventure of traveling around the world, “Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days”. Palin, a well-known British comedian, and actor, became even more famous after the show and one of the most popular travel writers of his generation.\\nThe idea behind the series was to take Jules Verne’s classic and recreate the steps of the fictional character, Phileas Fogg, putting Michael Palin at the center of the action as the intrepid explorer who turns what the French author created into reality.\\nThe conditions were the same: Palin had to travel around the world in 80 days without flying. Which he achieved, trying to stay true to Phileas Fogg’s original route. He took a crew of five people, appropriately named Passepartout, a reference to Fogg’s loyal French servant.\\nIn the seven-episode series, Michael Palin departs from the real Reform Club on Pall Mall in London, crossing the English Channel, traveling overland to Venice where he boards a ship to Athens. He continues from there, with a pit stop in Crete, and reaches Egypt. A series of real-life adventures take place. In Innsbruck, the expedition came to a halt due to a strike of Italian railroad workers, and they lose the connection to Muscat, Oman in Saudi Arabia. A diplomatic marathon follows, and the group finally gets permission to drive across Saudi Arabia, a part of the trip that’s only shown in photos on the show.\\nIn Dubai, they find a dhow (a traditional boat) willing to take them to India. When they reach Mumbai, they find out they’re a week behind on the fictional trip they wish to recreate.\\nAfter traveling by train, they reach the port of Madras, where it won’t be easy to find a ship to take them to Singapore. Palin finally reaches an understanding with a Yugoslavian captain that agrees to take him. But only one cameraman can travel with him.\\nOn his way to Singapore, Palin hopes to reach in time to catch the boat for the next leg to Hong Kong. But by the time he reaches Singapore he finds out the ship has sailed. Just like in a Hollywood movie, they rent a speed boat that catches up to the cargo ship in no time.\\nAfter some time traveling in China, he boards a ship to Yokohama, just like Phileas Fogg, and then reaches Tokyo where he spends a night in a capsule hotel – a sign of modern times. The next day he boards a container ship to the coast of California for 11 dull days.\\nBy the time he reaches the United States, he’s picked up the pace and is only behind two days. After dramatic episodes and a nerve-wracking race against time, he reaches New York. He embarks on the last leg of his trip, across the Atlantic on another cargo ship that takes seven days to reach the United Kingdom. Michael Palin completed his challenge in precisely 79 days and 7 hours.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Asia, Central, and South Americas are under a medium level of difficulty for travelers.\\nWhat to consider when planning a trip\\nWhat do you plan on doing while on vacation?\\nDo you want to spend your time at the beach?\\nDo you prefer sightseeing (museums/monuments/culture)?\\nDesert or mountain?\\nA developed or a developing country?\\nCity or country?\\nDriving or taking public transportation?\\nIf you are an inexperienced traveler, countries like France, England, Holland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the USA or Canada are the best choices for you, since they do not present many challenges. On the other hand, countries like Somalia or Afghanistan should be left for people with much experience on the road and the assurance that comes with it.\\nCountries and respective degrees of difficulty\\nEl Salvador border welcome sign – Central America\\nEasy countries to travel:\\nAll the European Union, Canada, the USA, Turkey, Iran, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and so on.\\nMedium-difficulty countries to travel:\\nMorocco, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Central and South Americas, Russia, Belarus, Ethiopia, Nepal, Ukraine, China and Southeast Asia, South Africa, Jordan, and so on.\\nHard countries to travel:\\nWest Africa, Central Africa, East and Southern Africa, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, and so on.\\nExtremely hard countries to travel through:\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Mali, Chad, Niger, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, and so on.\\nCountries where getting a tourist visa is hard:\\nSaudi Arabia, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Turkmenistan, Algeria, and so on.\\nRead my page about: How to get a Saudi Arabia Tourist Visa.\\nCountries at war or armed conflict:\\nAfghanistan, Somalia, Mexico, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Colombia, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine and Israel, Indonesia, India, North Korea, Philippines, Nigeria, Thailand, Russia, Libya, Lebanon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Central African Republic, Mali, Algeria, Niger, and Chad.\\n3. Tips on how to pack your bag\\nHow to pack your backpack\\nPacking your bag is where you should take your time.\\nWhy?\\nIf you do not think your packing through, you will end up taking a huge suitcase/backpack filled with stuff you will not actually use or need on the road.\\nNot sure if this is true?\\nTraveling the world means freedom, and freedom means independence. Now, carrying a much too heavy bag/suitcase around doesn’t sound very independent, does it?\\nSo, choose wisely what to pack. Take only what you really, truly need, and always travel light. Make sure the bag you carry with you never weighs more than 15 kg (33 lbs). My backpack weighs 12 kg (26 lbs) full, but I usually only take 8 to 10 kg (17 to 22 lbs) around.\\nSo, how to pack light and still take everything you need?\\nYour primary goal should be taking carry-on luggage – the kind you can take with into the plane without checking it in. That way, your things are always with you, you save time at the airports (no waiting for your baggage), and you can move around freely.\\nHere is an example of a simple thing you can do to travel light: Take a comfortable pair of walking shoes and a great pair of flip-flops. If it is a short trip, you can surely wear the same shoes the entire time.\\nOn the other hand, if you are traveling around the world or for several months in a row, just buy new shoes when your old ones are worn out. You will find that shopping for a new pair in a foreign country is both easy and fun.\\nAnother essential thing to remember is to wash your clothes. If you are going on a two-week trip, are you packing a clean change of clothes for each day? That is not right.\\nYou need to learn to wash your clothes at the hotel or use the laundry service at the place you are staying in instead. Most hotels, hostels, and inns have this service at your disposal. Plan your bag so you can wash your dirty clothes once a week, at least.\\nI never take more than three days’ worth of underwear in my bag because I will wash it every day. That way, I always have clean underwear.\\nI have a very thorough page on how to wash your clothes on the road.\\nUseful stuff to bring along: a power strip, to charge your cell phone, laptop, tablet, and camera at the same time. In case you need to recharge several things at once and there is only one power outlet in your hotel room, a power strip is an excellent solution.\\nBottles of shampoo in small travel size for all the containers you will be taking with you. Buy all your toiletries in travel size bottles so that you can bring them with you in your carry-on—these will last you for weeks, and when they are empty, you can always go to a supermarket and buy some more. They are smaller, lighter and the only size you can take with you on the plane.\\nSuitcase or backpack?\\nA backpack has the added advantage of being easier to carry around on your shoulders. A suitcase can only be carried in one hand at the time, which gets tiresome after a while. Taking a sturdy backpack, of a well-known brand and with lots of pockets, helps you make the most of your trip.\\nRead my page about: Travel Gear.\\n4. Health care – Vaccination and health care on the road\\nInternational Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis – Health care on the road\\nYour health is your most treasured possession and getting sick on a trip can ruin your plans, so always take good care of yourself.\\nIt is crucial to know which vaccines you need to make before going overseas. Some are the regular ones that you take periodically.\\nHowever, the most important shots you have to get before leaving for some parts of the world are the vaccines for yellow fever, cholera, diphtheria, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A and B, influenza, rabies, tetanus and typhoid.\\nThe International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis is the recorded proof of yellow fever immunization that you should keep with you at all times since some countries will require it before allowing you entry.\\nVisit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and learn more on vaccination and other health care advice.\\nAlways carry some cold medicine and diarrhea medication in your bag. When traveling to a tropical region, bring some antimalarials with you to either prevent or treat malaria. Do a full dental check-up before leaving your country. There are very few things worse than a toothache, especially when you are away from home trying to enjoy yourself.\\nMake sure you take a vitamin supplement while traveling—it will strengthen your immunity system. If you are on an extended trip, get your multivitamins every four months. You can easily get these supplements at a drugstore anywhere in the world.\\nGetting a travel insurance plan is essential for your peace of mind while traveling—just knowing that your belongings are insured and that you will be reimbursed should something happen to them, or even to you, makes all the difference.\\nTravel insurance plans cover loss or theft of your travel documents, baggage theft, flight delay or loss, health care abroad, and more.\\nRead my page: Travel Insurance – all you need to know and step-by-step Tutorial.\\n5. Buying a plane ticket\\nBuying a plane ticket\\nNow, this is a favorite among many of us when planning a trip.\\nBuying a plane ticket is as easy as pie. Just be sure not to buy your ticket through a traveling agency. Go on the internet and get it there. Avoid the fees a traveling company would charge you for something you can do yourself.\\nThe cost of a ticket depends on the patience and time you are willing to spend looking for it. If money is not an issue, then there is no need for planning ahead—you just have to buy it. However, if you do not want to spend more than you have to and don’t mind wasting 2 or 3 hours of your time on it, you will find the perfect plane ticket for you at a lower price.\\nHow?\\nTicket prices vary according to different airline companies, days of the week, on whether you buy it beforehand or if it is a layover flight, and so on.\\n6. Ordering a Travel Guide Book\\nOrdering a Travel Guide Book\\nSometimes I travel with guidebooks. Sometimes I don’t.\\nBut,\\nPersonal preferences for travel guides\\nThe DK – Dorling Kindersley and Lonely Planet. I also like the Rough Guides.\\nWhen you buy one of these two books, you will not just get a regular travel guide. Along with information on the traditions, culture, and history of the region you are visiting, they also provide useful advice on what to see and the best places to go, stay and eat.\\nThese two travel guides add to each other. While one is filled with history, photos, helpful schemes and drawings, the other has loads of useful travel information. These are an excellent addition to every traveler’s backpack and library.\\n7. Booking a room online – Hotel and Hostels\\nBooking a room online – Hotel and Hostels\\nRemember always to book a room for the first two nights. That way you will make sure you get your bearings in a safe and thought-out way.\\n» Booking.com is the site for finding the best deals on all your stays, especially if you prefer staying at hotels. This is a great site with compelling seasonal promotions, and there are even hotels offering “web specials” up to 50% discount on your reservation.\\n» Hostelworld.com is perfect for the wandering backpacker. Don’t forget that, during high season, some cities, like Rome, Venice, Reykjavik, New York, Madrid, and Paris, tend to get crowded and it is hard to get a bed at a hostel on short notice.

       " ['Table of Contents\\nHOW TO USE BOOKING.COM\\nThe online reservation platform Booking.com, based in Amsterdam and founded in 1996, is the biggest company of its kind and the 52nd most used website in the world.\\nIt’s an excellent tool for travelers to search for and book accommodation while exploring the world. Initially, it only included hotels, but over time it’s started to include other accommodation options like hostels and short-term rental apartments.\\nHOW TO BOOK A HOTEL ONLINE\\nFor many years that I only use Booking.com to book hotels, hostels and some apartments.\\nWhy?\\nWell, many hotels have promotions and special online prices. But what I like the most, is to be able to have all the hotels right there within one mouse click distance. Being able to choose the location and price that suits me the best. It really is a very useful and well crafted website. Easy and intuitive.\\nCome with me and let’s learn how to use Booking.com.\\nHow to use Booking.com: a step-by-step tutorial\\nStep One – The Basics\\nThe first step to use Booking.com is to select your language and currency.\\nThen, select your destination, dates, and how many people are traveling. Here you can choose how many rooms you need for your travel group. If you know exactly what hotel you want, you can type in the name of the hotel in the search box instead of the destination.\\nStep Two – First Overall Selection\\nAfter completing step one, you’ll have a list of possible accommodation options from where you’ll make your final decision (step three).\\nBooking.com will show you all the available options considering how many people are traveling and when. At the top of the page, you can see the total of hotels available\\nBooking.com filters the available hotels following their own criteria called “Our Top Picks.” The user can further refine the list, filtering by:\\nDistance from city center (public transport);\\nPrice (lowest first);\\nReview score and price;\\nStars, which is a somewhat obsolete standard in the hotel industry;\\nTop reviewed, meaning the ones that have more customer reviews and comments.\\nThe user will then see a list of available properties, 35 per page. If there are more than 35 possibilities, you’ll have to go on to the next page after you scrolled to the end.\\nThis page shows you a summary of each hotel that includes the main photo, the name, number of stars, the price for the total number of nights, the number of reviews from previous guests, and the average score.\\nIf budget is a concern, you can filter the list to see the cheapest options first. Guests who value the quality of service above all should filter the list by top reviewed, which shows the places with the highest scores.\\nOn the left-hand sidebar, you can filter by other criteria that will narrow down your options. Those criteria are personal, tailored to each user’s preferences, but there are plenty of options. To give you just some examples of the most used criteria, you can rule out options that don’t fit your budget, with low ratings, that doesn’t offer free cancellation, or that doesn’t have internet or complimentary breakfast.\\nIf you prefer to choose based on location, you can see a map of the area with all the options tagged. When you hover over the tags of each accommodation, you’ll have a popup box with the essential information about each option. This is one of the main advantages of Booking.com versus AirBnB, which never shows you the exact location until you make a reservation. Location could make the difference! However, please note that the hotel determines its location on the website and it might not be accurate.\\nSome things to consider when it’s time to choose:\\nDistance from the city center or main points of interest, or even distance from transportation such as the airport\\nThe higher the average customer score, the higher the chances of having a pleasant stay. See how many people have rated the hotel already because the higher the number, the more reliable that average is.\\nComplimentary breakfast is a nice touch\\nInternet access is fundamental, at least to me\\nStep Three – The Final Selection\\nAfter you’ve browsed the list of possible accommodations, filtered and ordered them, it’s time to take a closer look at the final list.\\nIf you’re on your laptop or desktop computer, open the link to each property in a new tab. That way you can compare them easily and go back and forth to each option to clarify any details.\\nWhen looking at the detailed description of a property, you’ll see several images, a description, and a summary of the main facilities listed and with icons. Closer to the bottom of the page, there’s a table with the different types of room available, including the maximum number of guests per room, what’s included in the price, if breakfast is complimentary, and cancellation policy. By clicking on the type of room, for example, “Superior Double Room,” you’ll open a popup window with specific details and photos.\\nScrolling down, you’ll find information about the distance between the hotel and relevant points of interest like closest landmarks, closest train or bus station, as well as a detailed list of everything the accommodation includes.\\nAfter this, you must check relevant information like check-in and check-out times, accepted payment methods, if pets are allowed, and specific conditions for children.\\nSometimes the same room shows different prices. This varies based on the number of people staying there, if it includes breakfast, and if it has free cancellation.\\nStep Four – Booking\\nOnce you’ve decided where you want to stay, it’s time to book it.\\nChoose how many rooms you’ll need. Usually, you don’t need to change the number you’ve pre-selected when browsing.\\nFill in your data or log in if you have an account on booking.com.\\nIf you have any special requests, like a specific type of room or you need information about transportation to reach the hotel, type that information in the special requests box at the bottom of the page.\\nIf you have that information, state your time of arrival.\\nWhen finishing the booking process, you might be asked for your credit card information. That has to do with the booking conditions. Even when you have free cancellation up until the day of arrival, the hotel is entitled to charge you for your stay, in full or partially, in case you never cancel your reservation or never show up. That’s why sometimes the website asks you for your credit card details, not to charge you but to ensure payment in case of a no show. Some places demand that you pay with a credit card upfront, but those cases are becoming rarer.\\nAfter you’ve completed your reservation, you’ll receive a confirmation email that you can print and show to the hotel when you check-in.\\nWhat’s Genius?\\nGenius is a special program by Booking.com for frequent users, offering special discounts and conditions, such as extended times of check-in and check-out. It might also include other benefits like free transportation from the airport or complimentary drinks on arrival.\\nBut to have these benefits, the hotel you chose has to be a participant in the program, which is not mandatory.\\nTips for booking a hotel through Booking.com\\nNice hotel in Cappadocia – Turkey\\nI recommend you create an account on Booking.com so you can create favorites’ lists and save time when filling your details for booking\\nKeep in mind that a city or a tourist tax might be added to your final price. It won’t be much, but make sure you account for that.\\nMake sure you arrive within the check-in schedule. Usually, if you arrive too early, you can drop off your luggage and go sightseeing, and many times they even allow you to take your bag into your room. But it’s trickier if you arrive after the reception’s closing hours.\\nWhen reading the reviews from previous guests, look for references to common problems that could rule out a place: excessive noise, lousy WiFi, bed bugs.\\nPrices are always charged in local currency. The prices shown in your preferred currency are just a reference. Keep this in mind because if the exchange rates fluctuate, the final price will change.\\nWhen reading the reviews from previous guests, you’ll notice they’re grouped by language, and you’ll need to define all the languages you understand. Otherwise, you won’t have access to all comments. The website will then automatically show you the comments written in your preferred languages.\\nAlso read my pages:\\nThe beginner’s guide to Couchsurfing\\nThe beginner’s guide to Hitchhiking\\nList of all the low-cost airlines in the world listed by continent\\nUseful words & phrases to know in every language before you travel\\n7 important tips on how to plan a trip – Travel planning ideas\\nTravel insurance – All you need to know\\nMy 52 best travel tips after 20 years of traveling the world\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Choose the option Visa Status on the website.\\nMake sure your country of origin or possible countries you’ll be traveling through aren’t listed as areas with Yellow Fever. If that is the case, you have to travel with your international vaccination record showing certified vaccination for that disease. Otherwise, you’ll be quarantined for six days, which is not a pleasant experience;\\nMake sure you have a print out of the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA), the electronic document given by authorities when your visa is granted. Considering how important the document is, I advise you to have more than one copy, stored in different places, and keeping a digital copy of the document on a platform you can easily access online;\\nShow that document at passport control of your entry point in the country.

Let’s see.\\nThe traditional visa is valid for six months after you enter India and you can request one for 1 to 5 years of traveling, depending on the type of visa. It’s more expensive, but it might be worth it for those who want to explore the country often. Not only can you stay for longer, but it will be easier to enter restricted territories, which are out of reach for travelers with the electronic visa.\\nThe traditional visa takes longer to issue, and it usually takes one to two weeks.\\nThe traditional visa allows you to enter India from any border, except overland, while the electronic visa has limited entry points and doesn’t include any land border.\\nTo get the traditional visa, you have to go to the nearest Indian embassy. Please note that before going to the Embassy, you must fill the online form.\\nOnce that is done, you must book your appointment with your embassy.  If you fill the form until 5:00 pm, you can go to the Embassy the next day. After that schedule, you can only go to the embassy two days later.\\nIt costs 90 Euros for a visa valid for one year or 190 Euros for a visa valid for five years. Add 2.50 Euros to this fee if you wish to have your passport mailed to you.\\nAlternatively, you can mail all forms and needed documents, which will be mailed back to you. Of course, this has additional costs. In that case, send the form filled and signed, two passport size photos, the passport and a money order for 100.50 Euros paid to the Embassy of India. This was the updated price in 2018, check with the Embassy if the same conditions apply.\\nFacebook Pinterest Twitter WhatsApp Messenger Email'],\n",

Consequently, and also due to my lack of time, I do not read travel blogs that much.\\nAs I got used to traveling at a time when there were no travel blogs on the Internet, I kind of mostly created my itineraries mixing information from history books; paper road maps such as Michelin, Reise Know-How or Freytag & Berndt; or using paper guidebooks such as The Rough Guides or Lonely Planet. In most cases, I just departed without knowing where I was going to or what I was about to visit.\\nThe experience of being on the road has always succeeded the destination itself.\\nDespite all that, and since the travel blogging community grew enormously, I somehow ended up following a relatively small number of bloggers, which sometimes enjoy reading and actively follow on social media. Since I am more of a practical person, my reading preference and selection of travel blogs will reflect useful travel information rather than individual travel stories on the road. I do not search nor read other people’s travel stories as I do prefer to naturally make my own choices, not getting influenced by the feelings or judgments of others. This means I always search for unique travel destinations, how to get there and indulge freely without preconceptions into a new world of my own experiences.

       "[['I am being interviewed, and the voice on the phone asks me why I’m not very social on social. It takes me a second to decode his words, or even his intent. Social on social? What?\\nIs it not part of your strategy? he asks. You know, do you not see it as an essential part of your business plan?\\nAnd well, let me just start there, because folks, there’s no business plan here.\\nI know that’s terribly unpopular to admit. I know it’s not wise to say, that here I am flying by the seat of my pants, just hitting publish when the mood strikes. But I’d be lying if I told you otherwise.\\nWant to hear something top-notch selfish?\\nI blog for myself. It’s not a sales funnel, or a secret mission, or one small sliver of my thirty-year-plan. It’s just that I do it every morning because I’ve always done it every morning, and it changes me for the better.\\nI write daily, in a chilly room with big windows a scratchy wool blanket, space heater at my feet. It is quiet. There is coffee.\\nAnd that’s it. I open a new post and I write whatever is on my mind, whatever I want to – or rather, whatever I need to. I write about bruised knees and bruised egos, and I write what I want to remember most about this very season of raising children and raising myself.\\nI publish perhaps 1% of this, because the lines get blurry when my story edges into someone else’s, and because relevance is less important to me than reverence.\\nAnd it’s a gift to publish it, truly. It’s a gift to send it all out into ether and have it returned to me a hundredfold. It’s a gift to read your sweet comments, your kind and encouraging words. It’s a gift, it’s a gift, it’s a gift.\\nSo I suppose I know what this interviewer was getting at. You have much to say, don’t you? So why aren’t you saying it? Why aren’t you playing the game?\\nAnd I haven’t uncovered the answer to this yet, not in my morning writing sessions, and certainly not in the span of 15 years online. But I want to, I do.\\n—\\nI offer many excuses: my hands are full. I don’t want the distraction. Twitter can be so loud, Instagram so carbon. Pinterest, a firehose. I quit Facebook ten years ago and found myself weightless again, no longer keeping up with the daily whereabouts of my high school salutatorian, now my mothers’ gynecologist.\\nI have, in the past, lived through seasons of robust social media usage and I have found those seasons to be the ones in which I am living the least. I have watched people leave the dinner table to get a wide shot of the spread, to post to their networks, to later return and find themselves having missed the passing of the gravy, the salt, an entire conversation.\\nI will not settle for such. (I’ve always wanted extra salt, after all.)\\nA few years ago, in a Jaipur tea house, I asked a friend how her culture defines success.\\nBy the health of our relationships, of course, she says, as if it were the obvious answer, as if it were everyone’s answer.\\nI know that it’s not everyone’s answer, but it’s my answer, and I wish it’s the one I’d given the reporter that day.\\nWhy are you not social on social?\\nThe health of my relationships.\\nOf course.\\n—\\nI know what he meant now, the reporter. I’m not terribly social on social, no. You will likely not find me producing an Instagram story in which I open my mail, or walk you through my closet, or offer a tour of my hometown. I used to think this was because I was private, which I am. Or because these things were sacred, which they are.\\nBut I think perhaps it’s those things, and also another:\\nWe cannot find each other here.\\nWe cannot find each other in the puppy filters, the self deprecation, the linkbait headlines. We are settling for a smattering of one dimension when we have three available to us, in ourselves and the next door neighbor and the grocer down the street.\\nIf I cannot bring you a casserole when your dog is dying, how social can we be?\\nI suppose I am writing all of this to say how much I appreciate this quiet room, and how much I treasure the white space available to type longer than 280 characters, to offer something deeper than a hashtag. I am writing this to say how much I appreciate you.\\nYou, who have never asked me to be a “good blogger.” You, who have never demanded an editorial calendar, who have never begged to see the contents of my closet, my junk drawer, my garage. You, who have never requested a giveaway loop, who have never once minded that my kids’ birthday parties come and go with nary a rainbow cake or confetti balloon. You, who consider me as a person, not an influencer portioning my life in the name of content.\\nYou, who are ever-patient with my lack of bullet point lists, or product round-ups, or click-worthy headlines. You, who read these small words despite my lack of brevity, and certainly without want for ramblings. ;)\\nYou, who if a post goes unpublished or a social media platform goes unvisited, have never once suggested I hire help, or scale up, to better manage my “work.”\\nYou, who have never once made this feel like work.\\n—\\nI know this is a time of year in which announcements are often made, changes often outlined. I know it’s proper to shake things up right about now, to start capitalizing on rich SEO terms – keto meal plans and coatigans. I know I should be rounding up the top wallpaper trends to look forward to, or 20 parenting books to add to your arsenal.\\nI should be using this space for more, it is taught.\\nAnd yet: this feels like just enough. You and me and stories, the backbone of our everydays unfettered by fluff. It feels right to assume you need no help from me in determining your daily outfits, or how to care for your fiddleleaf. It feels right to think you’re here for the same reasons I’m here – to shove the rest to the side and return to the basics, or at least to make a crack at it.\\n—\\nAnd so, here, I suppose the state of this space is the same as it has always been: both mine and yours. I promise to write when I can, to publish what I can, to attempt to learn from the both of it.\\nThank you for joining me, coatigans or not.'],\n",
       " ['I’ve seen the book covers, the IGTVs, the keynotes – women in eyelash extensions imploring you to stop playing small. Commandment after commandment, we’re offered the vaguest of measurements to stack ourselves against. Go all in! Show up big! Shine brighter!\\nClimb higher.\\nRun faster.\\nDream bigger.\\nYou were made for more!\\nBrick by brick, we build a Babel for one.\\n—\\nA memory: my kindergarten teacher, Ms. Redman. She was a quiet force, waltzing around the room in her favorite red pumps, hair twisted into a bun and secured with a pencil. When one of us twenty-something tots would cause havoc, she’d crouch down to meet our eyes. She’d get on our level so we’d feel safe, connected. She’d communicate that she’s paying attention, and she’d gently guide us in a new direction.\\nShe made herself small, and the result was anything but.\\n—\\nNow, three decades later, a 5-second scroll and a few clicks around might bring about any number of Ms. Redman’s adversaries, a new slew of “Play Big” prophets.

Slap on a foundation named “Your skin, but better!” before buying the Guide to Being Glorious You, downloading Secrets of the 100k Side Hustle, and reading 5 Essentials for the Best Morning Ever.\\nHow much time and money are we spending in search of our best life? Will we even know it when we’ve found it?\\nLast week, the kids and I trek to our local woods. We have grand plans to go sledding, but the hills aren’t steep enough and the snow is beginning to slush. For a moment, we’re disappointed.\\nSoon, I watch as they toss their sleds aside and settle for rolling downhill until their cheeks grow pink. When the younger turns thirsty, his sister shows him how to make a sno-cone in her mittens. Like this, see? she says. And there’s more! I can make more and more and more!\\nThe day inches on with shrieks and tumbles, our socks wet and spirits high. As the late afternoon melts into darkness, I lead the kids back onto the path. They trot close behind, thrumming with energy, deeming our short adventure “the best ever.”\\n(I don’t know if we played big, or if we played small. I know only that we played.)\\n—\\nWilliam James once wrote in a letter years ago:\\n“I am done with great things and big things, great institutions and big success, and I am for those tiny, invisible molecular moral forces that work from individual to individual, creeping through the crannies of the world like so many rootlets, or like the capillary oozing of water, yet which if you give them time, will rend the hardest monuments of man’s pride.”\\nOne small theory, then: If we want to live our best life ever, we must first aim for a good one.\\nReturn your grocery cart to the corral. Look the barista in the eye. Plant a walnut tree. Ladle at a soup kitchen. Clap for the street performer. Smile at a stranger. Set the table. Shovel the sidewalk. Rock the baby. Wander the trail. Leave milk for the stray.\\nIt’s not a side hustle.\\nIt’s the whole good race.']]"
